Prague, Czech Republic
Good choice for travelers having car and looking for a comfy stay for reasonable prices
If you`re commuting by car and looking for a nice, comfy place to stay for 2-3 nights, it`s the perfect spot. It`s a little bit far from the city but there`s tramp stops in 10 mins walk and metro 15 mins walk. It has nice rooms(beds, kettle and tea&coffe, large bathrooms, fully carpet covered floor), decent breakfast within a large stylish dining area, very affordable private parking(5 euros per night), comfort of a 4 star hotel.

Lovely
I’ll be honest, we were dumped here by an airline after our flight was cancelled so viewed the hotel with trepidation.
BUT it was marvellous, the reception staff quickly managed a bus load of upset people quickly and efficiently.
The rooms are good with all facilities you might need.
The breakfast was gorgeous with so many choices.

Special shout out to the bar and reception staff (I wish I had noted their names) who helped us weary travelers however they possibly could.

If I ever go to Vienna again (on purpose this time) this hotel will be first on the list to look at.

Good choice when in a hurry and more interested in having a place to sleep
The overall set-up of the rooms is comfortable and quite stylish. However not to the level of a 4-star hotel. Also, the staff is not always ready to welcome and provide you with their help. I believe that it was more a matter of organization in our case when they failed to inform us about the fee for dogs. Nonetheless, they have apologiezed and finally, we didn't have to pay for our dog's stay.

First visit to Vienna
Good enough Hotel for a small break, hotel was located not far from city centre , local transport also available outside the hotel, good 45-60 minute walk to the town centre. Bit disappointed about breakfast service as lack of staff at the breakfast area, every morning we had to ask for things to be topped up as 1 person couldn’t do everything, felt sorry for the guy, hope things will improve . Good overall experience.

Bucharest, Romania
I would book again.
We arrived with 2 hours before the check-in hour, and luckly there were no issues. I loved everything about this hotel. Quiet, modern, beautiful design, lots of mirrors, spacious bath tub, not too far from the metro station - 10 mins walk, big windows and lots of natural light - with blackout curtain.

My partner didn't liked the TV. We forgot to pack a HDMI cable and the only thing in english was news,politics, and nickelodeon.

I would book again without second thoughts! :)

P.S: booked for 6days, didn't ate at the hotel.

The hotel that does not stick to its own rules!!
We left the downtown early with the hope of spending time at the bar of our hotel, because we knew that it was 1 hour earlier than the hotel cafe-bar closing!! Exactly at 11:30 pm they kept saying we are closed eventhough at all documents it was told they close at 00:30 am!! Do not make your social plans regarding the existence of your hotel because it does not exist!!!

Really nice hotel
I stayed at this hotel for one night during a business trip. It is a really nice hotel, I would recommend staying here. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of this hotel:

+ big rooms, a lot of space
+ nice breakfast
+ you can choose what kind of pillow you would like to have, which a huge plus for me, since I always have problems with my neck from hotel pillows
+ nice staff

- the parking place is a bit more difficult to find if you are driving with navigation. There are no signs, until it is too late and you have to drive around the hotel to be able to park.

Overall a very nice hotel and I recommend it when visiting Vienna.

Deggendorf, Germany
Financial irregularities and unwillingness to communicate
The large hotel is located southeast of the centre of Vienna. It offers a free, barrier-secured car park. In this respect it stands out from many other hotels in Vienna. The best way to reach downtown is by tram, which stops near the hotel.
Our room was predominantly furnished in brown and had all the expected furnishings, such as a large TV set, a spacious safe, a fridge and a Nespresso machine. The free WLAN worked without problems.
Bathroom and toilet were in separate rooms, both attractively designed. The shower was integrated into the bathtub.
Despite of these positive elements, the hotel cannot be recommended. This is why:
Although we pointed out on check-in that our reservation was via booking.com the room rate was charged twice. A complaint by e-mail in this matter was not answered. Only after the intervention of booking.com the Doppio was willing to reimburse the overcharged amount weeks later.
There seems to be urgent need for the hotel management to scrutinize both the operation of their accounting department and their customer relations service.

HORRIBLE!!!
Avoid this place at all costs! The location is useless, everything is closed by 6pm, it's far from the city center, the management are thrived who book your stay, take your money CANCEL your booking upon arrival and then tell you, not my problem. We arrived from Africa only to be told they don't have any rooms, our booking was canceled because they were overbooked for a convention and they couldn't do anything for us. There was another woman in the lobby who had the same situation. We found another hotel, they said they would pay for our taxi ride over and now they refuse, but the best part....they refuse to refund our booking that they themselves cancelled!!!! FYI, everyone in their lobby was over 85 years old and a coffee in the lobby was €6

You're better off sleeping under a bridge!!

Very clean and very nice breakfast
I have stayed two nights in this hotel and i can say that the rooms are very clean, the bathrooms are spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the room is very warm. The best part of this hotel is the breakfast, it has many different things to taste and the staff is really polite. I would reccomend it to everyone who will visit Vienna. :)
