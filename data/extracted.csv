Рядом есть отель подороже и по интереснее для тех кому цена в 15 долларов покажется не приличной, кстати цена указана на стойке, и не пытались обмануть. Комнаты большие, обстановка и санузлы стандартные для Азии , туалетные принадлежности и водичка выдается.

15	S. Skapo g. 8, Vilnius 01122 Lithuania	I had an issue with bathroom boiler. Apparently, if you want to take a bath, you must put on hot water first and wait until it finishes (about half way full). After hot water is finished, you'll only get cold water in the bathroom, but if you mix it with hot, you'll get a full bath of warm water :) This is amazing place location wise and all things consider it's not expensive. For the same price you'll get much smaller room in any hotel.

31	Aicherstrasse 7-9, 89191 Nellingen, Baden-Württemberg Germany	Like others, we had an overnight stop at Hotel Krone on our transit to Slovenia and Croatia. We booked a room in the main guest house. Our room was huge and tastefully furnished. Our only regret was the restaurant. The posted menu looks mouth-watering, but on the day our stay the kitchen was out of action as the chef was off sick and other staff were away on vacation. A shame as one of the criteria for booking had been the restaurant menu. The breakfast was OK - though not brilliant. There was a simple self-service buffet with a small selection of cured meats and cheeses to choose from. Definitely something that the hotel owners should consider improving. Would we return or recommend to others? Definitely YES.

The breakfast buffet is pretty standard german inspired. The pool area is great where you can enjoy the view over lake garda - we had a fantastic sunny day there :) After 2 weeks of traveling in Italy we have had so much great food to a decent price - so here we were really disapointed. The pizzas are good, but the rest of the food, both half pension + a la carte, we got were very borring/tasteless and way too expensive compared to what we have had at other restaurants around the country.

43	6 The Parade, Tumbarumba, New South Wales 2653 Australia	When I’m staying in a pub I expect noise until after the bar closes. That’s predictable. What wasn’t predictable was that every door lock on every room was stiff and in people getting up to use the bathroom made more racket than a series of car crashes. I’m not exaggerating. We got about an hours sleep. The locks need servicing or better still, replacing. For $50 I’m not going to complain about anything else, as my expectations are always triggered by the tariff price.

Visitors getting their vehicles beware. The food is also not good. In breakfast they serve only 3 items viz., bread butter, a South indian item and Poha. Also the lunch items were also not at all good. The worst part was high tea in which they again serve bread butter, biscuits, tea-coffee and bhajiyas. The service is so bad that we had to literally wait for half an hour for the pakodas and the pakodas given thereafter were half fried. In the name of activities they have sky cycle, paddle boat, kayaking and swimming. However with limited attendants conducting the activities, activities are conducted on rotation basis i.e. when sky cycle is operated, boating activities are stopped due to shortage of staff conducting the activities. Compared to the cost of Rs 1000 for day picnic, the experience is not at all worth. There are much better options elsewhere at cheaper prices and offering more options with decent food.

Están bien equipados con vajilla, cubertería, cristalería, útiles de cocina... etc. El aire acondicionado funcionó bien -cosa que agradecimos inmensamente por las fechas en las que viajamos. Hay un Carrefour Express cerca, lo que también facilitó la estancia. También hay una farmacia muy cerca. Los apartamentos no son accesibles: tienen dos pisos, arriba está la habitación y el baño, abajo la cocina y el salón. El ascensor del edificio es pequeño (3 personas max.) pero cumple correctamente su función. Cabe destacar que los apartamentos están en un 4º piso. Dan al patio, y para acceder a ellos hay que pasar por un estrecho balcón de no más de 1m de anchura. Abstenerse personas con vértigo... Tengan en cuenta que a pesar de que hay que abonar 30€ extra por el servicio de limpieza, éste no se refiere al diario, sino al que se realiza tras la marcha de las personas alojadas.

Andere Räume werden von der Familie bewohnt, so dass man hier das Gefühl hat, nicht ein externer Gast zu sein, sondern irgendwie dazu zu gehören. Lage: Das Haus liegt ziemlich zentral in Moos, ein paar Meter abseits der Hauptstraße direkt am Sextener Bach. Dieser ist recht laut, so dass das gleichmäßige Rauschen die Geräusche von der Straße gut übertönt. Ruhig ist es nicht, aber die Geräuschkulisse stört nicht. Bis zur Bushaltestelle sind es ca. 50m, Supermarkt und Bäckerei 100m. Im Sommer sind die drei Aufstiegsanlagen zu Fuß erreichbar, im Winter sind mehr in Betrieb. Viele Wander- und Klettermöglichkeiten in vielen Schwierigkeitsstufen. Service: Die Betreiberinnen sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, sorgen für ein sauberes Haus und helfen einem mit Tips für Wanderungen und Ausflüge. Jeden Tag gibt es zum Frühstück einen Zettel mit dem Wetter und den Veranstaltungen. Gastronomie: Frühstück: Buffet mit Wurst, Käse, Müsli, selbstgemachtem Joghurt, frischen Brötchen, Kuchen, Tee, diversen Kaffeevarianten, Eier und Speck auf Wunsch in unterschiedlichen Versionen. Abendessen: Unterschiedliche Menüs (meist einmal pro Woche) mit dem, was es gerade gibt. Sehr lecker und gut zubereitet. Zimmer: Die Zimmer sind geräumig, ins sehr gutem Zustand und extrem sauber. Ausstattung: Bett mit guter Matraze, großer Schrank, Nachttisch mit Schubladen, Fernseher, Safe, kleiner Tisch mit stühlen. Badezimmer ausreichend groß und auch extrem sauber.

83	Rua do Salitre 91, Lisbon 1250-198 Portugal	Stylish apartment, large balcony, close to the centre, ample and light living room. Sounded and looked good to us and is true. BUT: The company who offer a large number of apartments is obviously not capable or willing to provide a minimum quality of service: The first problem was: We wanted to book a different apartment first (via booking.com), but our reservation was cancelled because the payment via credit card was not possible since the redirection to the website of my bank did not work. Therefore no possibility to enter Mastercard-Secure-Code and TAN. I suggested payment via SEPA money transfer, but no response by the company. After several attempts to contact the company I finally reached a friendly person who told me that the apartment was not available any more, but that she could offer the apartment in Rua do Salitre 91 and that she would accept payment via SEPA transfer. The next problem: We were asked to announce our arrival time and told them a time frame from 15:15 to 15:45. We arrived there at 15:30, no one was there. After calling again an employee showed up aroud 15:50, showed us the apartment in less than five minutes (did not even show how to convert the sofa to a bed) and left. THe third problem: We would have needed a second key (we were 4 persons). They could not provide one and told us that not even they themselves have a second key (and were very eager to obtain the key when we left). The fourth problem: Maintenance of the apartment: In the bathroom only one lamp was working and gave only a dim light. One of the taps was loose. Using the shower regularly caused flooding of the bathroom-floor since obviously the drain did not work properly. There was no possibility to report these shortcomings or to get them repaired (since they have no second key). Fifth problem: Minimalistic supply: Only one towel per person, no dishcloth, no tabs for the dishwasher, no detergent, no cleaning sponge etc. Summing up: Could make a perfect stay if the company would do their job properly.

Everything is just bad about this place - location is very hard to find, my driver had to make at least 3 rounds to find it. You have to walk long distance including almost 100 steps to reach there, and the walk way is too dirty. If you are looking for work out during your trip, those 100 steps will help you sweat it out. There is no safety and security. Anybody can simply walk into that place and even broke into your room easily. There is a care who is of not much use.

Locating the property was easy using the sat nav and we were greeted by the most incredibly friendly and attentive hosts. The property is stunning and the photos online are very accurate. There are two caravans and my children were able to choose which one we had - they chose the green one! The accommodation is very comfortable. Each van has a double bed on a raised area and then a sofa that opens into two full size singles - all the beds are very comfortable and have beautiful bed linens and cushions. The vans are completed with a small shower room and also have tea and coffee making facilities. The main house is a short walk and it houses the dining room - again, this is a beautiful room! We ordered an evening meal in addition to the included breakfast and I am so glad that we did - it was a great value 3 course meal which we all declared to be the best that we had all holiday! Breakfast was great too - croissants, breads and conserves. The hosts were very attentive and went out of their way to ask what we would all like - including the children. All in all this was a fabulous stay and we highly recommend it. We all agree that it's the most unique b&amp;b we have stayed in and we are all wanting to return next year!

163	665 Seimei-cho, Tomikoji Nishi-iru,Nijodori, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto 604-0951 Kyoto Prefecture	We had a great stay. We booked only for 1 night, that is all our schedule allowed. Hirota greeted us with cookies and green tea. She found out how much time we had and gave us advice what to see and do in that short amount of time, the treasures of Kyoto that we shouldn't miss. Her advice was priceless!!! We didn't stay in the garden. But the rooms facing the street were very nice and all had heaters in case you were going to get cold at night. I appriciated this as I get cold often. Rooms were very clean, clean sheets. Nothing to complain about. Location was a quick walk to downtown. Drew where we were on a map, drew bus stops etc. Couldn't be any more helpful, plus was very nice.

Just opposite the Kasbah a few meters up a lane, which means a lot in a town so steep and confusing that every meter counts. It also has a nice rooftop with panoramic views. But it could use an upgrade and a lot of cleaning. The aircon was out of order and the window too small to make a difference. There was no hot water, and the water in Chaoen is freezing cold! When we told the guy he suggested we use the common shower. You can get better places to stay for this price, but if a bed with clean sheets and towels is all you’re after, Barcelona is not a bad choice.

200	1 Polevaya ulitsa 2, Palekh 155620 Russia	Бронировали номер через букинг.ком на 2 взрослых и 2 детей за 1200 руб. По приезду выяснилось, что в номере за 1200 есть только 1 кровать, и нам предложили другой с 4 кроватями, но уже за 1600 руб. Спорить не стали, и доплатили. Хозяйка отказалась нам выписать квитанцию или дать чек на новую сумму, чтобы не платить с разницы комиссию букингу. Очень странное поведение хозяев наложило некоторый отпечаток, но сам хостел вполне пригоден для проживания - чисто и уютно.

244	Georgina River, Camooweal, Queensland Australia	Just to the west of Camooweal, there are two billabongs with camping sites available along there length. Most campers seem to stop at the first so go a bit further for a more tranquil and isolated experience. The billabongs are pretty: Lillie’s in bloom at the right time of year and prolific birdlife. greats sunsets as well. Must be self-contained as there are no amenities whatsoever. Great spot.

245	7 Makara Wat Damnak, Siem Reap Cambodia	The Central Privilege Hotel is an oasis in Siem Reap! The location is a short walk (or $2-3 USD tuktuk ride) to Pub Street and the Night Markets. This hotel is far enough away from the busy central area of Pub Street that you are able to relax and unwind from the hecticness of the Night Markets. The pool area is a great place to hang out and swim, plus there is a swim up bar :) The room was exceedingly clean and spacious as was the European style bathroom (shower not separate) but the floor drained quickly and dried. The bed was firm and the air conditioiner worked perfectly. I was sick my first 2 days in Siem Reap and I was so thankful I was staying here because the staff was friendly, knowledgable and the room was perfect. The Wifi was strong throughout the hotel. I highly recommend staying at the Central Privilege Hotel (also called the Indochine Hotel).	Excellent	4.5	9 reviews

The setting was absolutely beautiful.The weather was not great but we made the best of it. Unfortunately and sadly, the owner passed away two months ago and his wife and father were left to run everything. They are trying their hardest but it will take time. My heart is devastated for them. The only complaint I have is that the cabanas are not cleaned up to my standards. The towels need to be bleached and the two young guys who cleaned did not know how to clean well. They would just pour dawn on the floor and mop. The shower was very slimy.

276	65 Union Street, London SE1 1SG England	Good: The main thing going for this place is its location. Tbh for its price it wouldn't be worth it if it was anywhere less central and convenient than this. It is the sheer convenience of the location that makes it a passable place that I'd book again if I needed somewhere affordable this central as a solo traveller. There were also plenty of plug sockets, and late check in was possible. It seemed fairly clean in general. Less Good: The rooms are very small and cramped. The 9 bed dorms are a small room with 3 x triple bunk beds. It feels like trying to cram as many people as possible in. You cannot sit up in the bunk beds because of the space available It was very hot in the room and this was late October. I cannot imagine what it is like in the summer. People turned the lights on at 3am and there is one light switch by the door that turns ALL the lights on in the dorm. A good solution that I've seen at other hostels would be installing individual bedside stile lights in/by the bunks or running the lights on a timer so that people can't turn them on at ridiculous times. Also, the toilet seat was kind of broken.

The guy who worked there spoke 2% English, and couldn't understand a word. We had to talk to someone else over the phone who didn't speak English too, but he said something about a room. The first guy then said that his friend had a room we could stay in, and then all alarm clocks just rang and we got away as fast as we could. The place was moldy and smelled awful, plus the promised "kitchen" was not a kitchen just a gross fridge. So stay away.

I questioned that but was told that she would let it slip. Apart from that bad first impression the place was good, although a bit overpriced. You can rent bed linen and towels, and you have to clean the room after your stay (at least ib the studio) unless you wan to pay for that service. The room was modern with a TV, small kitchen and a large bedroom. However, there was only one bed and we were disappointed with the bed sofa - extremely uncomfortable! All in all, though, it's a good option compared to the other (very) expensive options in the town and if I were to return I'd most definitely stay here.

294	Hermann-Gmeiner-Strasse 51, Innsbruck 6020 Austria	Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel due notti. Ci siamo trovati molto bene, ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Posizione perfetta per visitare Innsbruck, a cinque minuti di macchina dal centro. L’hotel mette a disposizione delle biciclette. Le camere, da poco ristrutturate, sono molto belle, pulite e spaziose. Manca però un condizionatore e il terrazzino, nonostante sia molto ampio, è condiviso con altre camere e questo impedisce di mantenere la propria privacy. Bellissima la piscina con vista giardino e montagne. Ci siamo trovati veramente bene perché è una struttura pulita e tranquilla peccato però per la colazione, non è molto ricca e composta solo da pane, qualche misero frutto, marmellate confezionate, formaggio e insaccati. Nessun dolce.	Very good	3.5	2 reviews

298	Viale Venezia 9, 33054, Lignano Sabbiadoro Italy	Very nice and clean apartment with enough space for a family with 2 kids (additional 2 people could stay on a sofa, but not sure how confortable that would be). Our kids have plenty space to play and we also like the practical kitchen table for family breakfast. Unfortunately, the bathroom and specially the shower is very small, and that is not very practical when you get back with 2 small kids having sand everywhere. Separate bedroom for kids was good, as our kids go to sleep sooner. The beds are a bit soft, but ok. Balcony directly above the pedestrian zone was providing a good holiday atmosphere, even when we could not spent evenings outside with other people, due to our small kids sleeping. If you have a biger car and plan to use it more often, its not perfect, as the parkind is small and its accessed via pedestrian zone, which is quite crowded in the evenings (we used our car just once during our stay amd it was ok). I would definately recomend this place.	Excellent	5.0	1 review				HOTEL CLASS 3.0 of 5 stars

The pension is located at the end of the village road with Venus Hotel opposite it, but cost a fraction of its price (Venus Hotel definitely is a good choice too, having said that, just more expensive and upscale). It is probably a 5-10 min walk to Pamukkale central, but really, it is not that far since the village is tiny. Wifi signal is stronger if you live nearer to the reception area. but since I was only there one night and not there to surf the internet, this wasnt an issue at all.

327	National Hwy, Near Petrol Station, Bario Baretto, Subic, Luzon 2200 Philippines	Ambon hotel in Bario baretto has got to be the worst hotel I have ever been to. Here's why - 1) The rooms stink There is the smell of dirty drains in all the ground floor rooms (which are the only ones you can get without air con). All the top floor rooms are air con, and still there is a stuffy smell in them. 2) The washroms / CR stink - again, the same stink - I thin from their drainage. Terrible. I had to go out to the supermarket and get a room freshener! When I told the front desk about this, they just laughed and then, on my insisting that something be done, said "go and find another place to stay then". Well I would hav, you idiots, except that it was late night, and I had already paid them (they require you to pay in advance) 3) We wanted to rest for just a few hours. They charged us 900 pesos for just 8 hours. Their room rate for a day is 1000 pesos. There are better hotels in this area (which I discovered later) in the same cost range. 4) Bedsheets are terribly thin, towels too are very rough. The beds have signs of someone having burnt holes in them (cigarettes?) Finally, we decided to just walk out, irrespective of the money we had paid. It was terrible. The reception was not at all apologetic - what a crappy place!	Terrible	1.0	1 review	Laundry service

357	Castello 4890 Ruga Giuffa, 30122 Venice Italy	We stayed here for 2 nights at the start of May 2019. The hotel is really central, within 10mins max walk to the water front and St Mark's Square. We originally went to the wrong building (our fault) as the hotel instructions told us to go to their main entrance. This wasn't a problem as we rang the buzzer and the owner came and met us and lead us a 1 minute walk up the street to the main hotel. The front door is really secure and you are given a main door key to gain access. The hotel is an old style Italian hotel, really nicely decorated with bright coloured wall paper and rooms. The reception area was really big with comfy seats that you could relax on, they also had a small balcony with seats that looked out onto a beautiful part of Venice. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room had a large double bed, table and chairs and an en-suite bathroom, the room also has a safe. The bathroom was a good size with a shower that was okay, not that powerful but done the job!! Although there is a TV in the room there is only Italian channels which is to be expected, so we used our laptop to watch Netflix after a long day exploring the city, They also have wifi which is really fast!! The hotel serves breakfast, however we did not use this service as we ate out as we were only in Venice for a few days and wanted to see as much as we could. As it is so central there are loads of restaurants and bars close by. We found a lovely little local bar called Bacaro, drinks were very cheap and they had a great selection of Italian tapas that you could chose from. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend for a short stay. Thanks for a lovely stay p.s if you are going to Venice at this time of year I recommend that you take mosquito spray...we didn't and got quite a few bites due to the city being all canals!! I never get bitten on holiday so this was a first for me!! Wish someone had told us this before we went!!

407	Avenida Miguel Hidalgo Co. Centro 807, Oaxaca 68000 Mexico	INITIAL IMPRESSION: The Real de Antequera is literally a 90 second walk away from the zocalo. We had requested an interior room originally, as we had read they were quieter. However, we found the room too small, dark, and boxy, and asked for a room change. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony and a view of the street (and a bit of the zocalo) at no extra charge. The noise was not an issue, with the exception of some overzealous marimba players on the zocalo. BUILDING: The building is a two-story former colonial mansion. Most of the second floor opens onto a balcony over the lobby. It is tastefully and charmingly painted, and very welcoming. ROOM IN GENERAL: The view of the street was excellent, and the balcony, while small, was charming, with potted plants around a wrought iron railing. The room was reasonably sized and received excellent light. We were visiting in December and January and there were no temperature regulation problems, but there were no airconditioners, only a standing fan. The room was kept clean through daily housekeeping visits. There was a small ant problem, however. BATHROOM: To enter the (private) bathroom, you had to step up, and the door separating the bathroom from the room did not block any noise. The water pressure and hot water were sometimes problematic. SERVICE: The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. None of them spoke English, but all made an excellent effort to communicate via circumlocution. There were safes available for the patrons, and the hotel staff kept our keys for us when we left the building, so we did not have to worry about our key being stolen. There was 24 hour desk service. OVERALL: Overall we were pleased with our experience, and would return there. It was a great place for a romantic vacation, and would also be well suited for a family getaway.

The objective was to enable guests to savour the natural beauty of the Periyar river,while staying in a homely setting,unhurried by rules as set in typical commercial resorts.

In line with theme of being environmentally friendly,most of the wood used in the resort is recycled from old buildings and furniture . Abandoning planned architecture associated with most commercial properties, the resort is built keeping space and privacy in mind. A guest can spend hours watching the fast flowing river in all its beauty. However,a typical morning after a leisurely breakfast could be spent lazing in the river at choice spots, letting the Periyar flow over and around you, for an experience of a lifetime. Following your frolic in the water, you could be treated to a foot massage by our trained masseur, lunch at your leisure and an afternoon siesta could be followed by a visit to the farm. For the more physically minded, a trek to the Paniyeli poru waterfalls could be arranged. For those who prefer to spend their time by the pool, an infinity pool is available. Our bamboo raft and country boats can be availed to explore the river and its magnificent surroundings. The produce from our vegetables farm and orchard will provide an organic flavor to your meals.

511	Siargao Circumferential Road, Burgos, Mindanao 8424 Philippines	Terrible treatment. From the room to the dining room 600 meters along a concrete walkway with terrible slopes and in the wet and at night, you risk your life. In the same dining room a gasoline generator set, as if you were dining next to a truck. Awful!!!!!. They ask you for 7,000 pesos as a deposit, which after deducting what they think, they return the rest..., imagine what the account looks like... You are trapped in the middle of nowhere, and obviously a prisoner of their services..., for example if it rains they close the kitchen (at 7:00 p.m.), so you are left without dinner. Although it is one of the most expensive hotels in Siargao, they don't even make your room, towels or anything. You pay luxury prices for the Philippines and you have backpacker hostel services. The worst experience in two months traveling through the Philippines. For half the price you have hotels in General Luna where you will be treated with care and the body of a king, and to visit the north of the island, which I do recommend, by motorcycle or taxi it will take an hour	Terrible	1.0	1 review

Die Zimmer verfügen über eine kleine Kochecke und ein eigenes Bad. Neben dem Haus hat es einen kleinen Aussenplatz zum Verweilen mit schöner Weitsicht. Wichtig zu wissen: in Štanjel selber hat es nur ein kleiner Mercador und ein (eher teureres) Restaurant. Weitere Restaurants sind dann mind. 2km entfernt. Adrijan ist ein äusserst hilfsbereiter und freundlicher Gastgeber, der viele gute Tipps für Unternehmungen in der Region hat. Da wir mit den Fahrrädern unterwegs waren und schon recht kaputt waren von der Tagesetappe, hat uns Adrijan sogar angeboten, für und zu kochen. Zum Frühstück gabs dann extra ein Sportler-Zmorge bestehend aus mit Käse überbackener Polenta, Spiegeleier, Tomaten, Früchten, Nüssen und Brot. Dazu Tee und extrem guten Kaffee.

592	376/41, Moo 2 Muang Krabi district, Ao Nang 81000 Thailand	OUR REPUTATION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF (We offer FREE BREAKFAST and a FREE BBQ EVERY DAY!!) The basis of the following information centers around two main questions ... DO YOU WANT US and DO WE WANT YOU. In an age where hostels can buy reviews or even worse write them themselves, we encourage you to conduct all necessary due diligence on your choice of hostel prior to your arrival in Ao Nang to avoid huge disappointment. If you are visiting this page it's highly likely that you are one of the numerous travellers that has heard about a ''SLUMBER PARTY PARTY''. We are proud that around 65% of our customers arrive through returning guests and referrals (a big thank you to those who have spread the word!). So let's get to it …. DO YOU WANT US? We make no excuses or apologies for the fact that we are the loudest and craziest party hostel in Ao Nang (possibly Thailand), our parties are famous and this is who we are. We strongly believe our commitment to this cause is the reason we are the busiest hostel in Ao Nang Krabi. Simply put, we give people what they want... 1. An unforgettable party 2. Clean and safe living conditions 3. A friendly and warm environment This simple formula has built the foundations of our success! Slumber Party is an established backpacker party hostel that has been running for years, it is NOT one of the numerous pop up, quick fix hostels in Ao Nang that promise the world but are under resourced, have poor hygiene levels and are poorly run...you know the kind we are talking about! DO WE WANT YOU? By not attempting to hide our reputation as the premier party hostel in South East Asia we are no doubt missing out on a few bookings here and there. However, make no mistake about it, this is deliberate! The reason? We are only looking to attract a certain type of person to our hostel, someone that fits the unique DNA of our owners, our staff and most importantly our other guests. Do you have the Slumber Party DNA? Here is what we are after: · A willingness to mix with others regardless of gender or nationality · A burning desire to have fun and smile · A respectful, open personality · A strong liver to cope with our head barman! Time and time again Slumber Party is the crowd pulling machine of Ao Nang, when everywhere is dead Slumber Party is ROCKING out Radness, which has quickly led to an enormous reputation. So before you book your accommodation on the Ao Nang here is a bit of advice from us… don't let yourself be one of the numerous travelers who drink with us at night having been left disappointed at the unfulfilled promises of other hostels in Ao Nang promising some sort of 'atmosphere'. Instead, get it right first time to avoid trying to change hostels half way through your trip! GENERAL PROPERTY INFORMATION You may have been warned by other travelers that Slumber Party is regularly SOLD OUT so early bookings are ESSENTIAL. Slumber Party sleeps over 50 people a night (80 including our beach property) and although we are essentially mixed gender, Slumber Party is renowned for being a FEMALE FRIENDLY hostel meaning that our female guests can look forward to the following privileges: · Regular drinks offers for our female guests · Special discounts on certain activities for girls that stay with us We offer 2 air conditioned mixed dorm rooms, our privacy is second to none with our custom designed pod beds and privacy curtains, every bed also features a reading light and wall plug, we also 8 private roms for people that are looking to have their own private ‘party’ :) Our central location offers a wide variety of restaurants, cafes, bars, parties and shops right on our doorstep.

637	Via Michele Cifarelli 10, 70124, Bari Italy	The email communication and booking process with the owner/landlord was fast and smooth, which is already a good sign. I arrived earlier so I called Giancarlo and he was there in 10 minutes. He showed me around, equipped with advice and taxi number, and I even got a discount since he had no cashback :) (but that does not mean you will go there and pay with a 500 Euro note :) I also wanted to see the terrace and he was OK although it was not ready for the season yet, and gave me the chiar pads. The room (Van Gogh) was spotless, super clean and the linens smelled amazing (see pictures). Distance from B&amp;B to Bari Central- walking 10 min, by Vespa it took 5 minutes, so taxi will be aprox.same, price 6 Euro. The only tiny little comment is that after leaving the patisserie at the kitchen counter, by morning it was surrounded by sugar ants, which are absolutely harmless but still, you might be put-off (so better to store food wrapped &amp; in the fridge) The kitchenette is quite equipped so you can actually toss a quick salad there, olive oild and aceto balsamico are in the cupboard)or jump to the bar on the street.

641	2741 Maringouin Rd. P.o.b. 158, Livonia, LA 70755	This is a great bed-n-breakfast off the main road in Livonia. If you were travelling through, you'd never know it was there, which is a shame. Camille and Manny are the proprietors, and they MORE than went out of their way to accomodate us while we were there. As working travellers, we kept very odd hours (sometimes out more than 24 hours) and Camille kept us fed and rested like a fairytale Mother Goose. She fussed over the guys every day, and even did our (very sandy/dirty) laundry. When one of our crews got stuck on the levee overnight, she took it upon herself to bring them a steak dinner (in a box). Manny similarly went above and beyond, working his local connections to find us an obscure bearing for a broken piece of equipment, even going so far as to call folks at home to come open their store. While we were not the typical B&amp;B travelers, we were welcomed and coddled here in a way that made us MUCH more comfortable and effective than we could have been anywhere else. I plan to return here with my wife and child, just to visit.

645	Lugar Candás, s/n, 32652 Rairiz de Veiga Spain	I'm pleased to have the opportunity to provide what appears to be the first English review of Ramón's property, which is almost in the middle of nowhere! We wanted to have an authentic experience of Galicia, and we certainly got it. Ramón is a very welcoming and enthusiastic host, full of local knowledge and advice on where to go and what to do. We thought that we had booked a room and breakfast, but having completed the checkin formalities, we were taken in the direction of the sitting/dining room and al fresco eating area alongside a well equipped and stocked kitchen which we were told to treat as home and settle up for what we used at the end of our stay. The location is high on a hill with some spectacular views, but accessed by some very narrow roads. A local farmer was quite worried about us making the last 100m of the journey without getting stuck. Overall a very peaceful and enjoyable stay.

The treated us like we were family friends and gave the children a tour of the farm and animals. The wine and food were incredible. Highly recommend doing the full board.

Back rooms have a nice view of the Konkan railway line as we see the trains slowing down as they approach the Honnavar railway station. Ample parking with trees which offer shade for the vehicles. No complimentary breakfast: This is actually good as you are not forced to eat at their restaurant.

Really felt like a home away from home. Book the spa suit, it was well worth it! The room was generous in size, with a TV, tea and coffee making facilities, a bar fridge, a wardrobe. It really is a wonderful place and quite well priced esp if you get an online deal. I would highly recommend it especially for a couples getaway.

682	Am Nattererhof 34, 87497 Wertach, Bavaria Germany	Wir kommen seit 18 Jahren immer wieder, vorwiegend über Weihnachten/Neujahr, aber auch einmal im Sommer für einen Kurzurlaub ins Landhaus nach Wertach. Dies hat seine Gründe und spricht eigentlich ohne viele Worte für sich. Man steigt aus dem Auto, öffnet die Tür von der Garage zum Haus und fühlt sich sofort heimisch. Das Ambiente beginnt sozusagen bereits im Kellerbereich, setzt sich über dem Empfangsbereich im 1. Stock bis zu den Wohnungen gleichermaßen fort. Es ist einfach Klasse, mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet und super gepflegt. Höchstes Niveau hat der Wellnessbereich, ein absoluter Traum. Ein Traumgastgeberpaar sind auch die Besitzer Renate und Hubert Linder, immer freundlich, immer gut gelaunt, hilfsbereit und nett. Das Landhaus liegt in einer ruhigen Wohngegend am westlichen Ortsrand von Wertach, auf der Rückseite nur noch Wiesen und Wald. Das Ortszentrum selbst erreicht man zu Fuß in 10 Minuten. Hier findet man alle Geschäfte, Sportstätten ( z.B. ein Freibad ), einen kleinen Kurpark und zwei Märkte. Nach 12km Fahrt ist man auf dem Oberjoch mitten in den Allgäuer Bergen. Im weiteren Umkreis von ca. 25km liegen Tannheim, Sonthofen, Fischen, Oberstdorf und das kleine Walsertal. Ideale Bedingungen also für einen Superurlaub mit höchstem Erholungswert. Wir genießen das seit 18 Jahren und freuen uns schon jetzt auf die Weihnachtszeit 2020 - spätestens.

689	Haunspergstrasse 41, Salzburg 5020 Austria	We spent 2 nights at the Mayburg Hotel prior to starting a hiking trip. Overall, the staff were very friendly and hard-working, and the hotel is trying to be hip, but it was just missing on the little things. We checked into our Junior Suite with a courtyard view on Friday evening. First noticed that there was no "courtyard view" in our room - we looked at the roof. While we weren't planning to spend much time in the room anyway, I was a little disappointed to look at the roof. Worse was that the air conditioning was not working and it was pretty hot that day, so the room was very warm. We opened the windows which did help but had to close them because it starting raining. Thankfully, it was fixed when we returned to our room on Sat afternoon. One other problem we noticed was the room lights. On Sat, the overhead room lights just came on suddenly at 8:00am despite the fact that we were still in bed sleeping. Overnight on Sat, the light on one bedside table suddenly came on at about 2:00am, waking me up from a sound sleep. Also, the bathroom has a nightlight that comes on if you enter the bathroom overnight when the lights are off. That's a nice feature, but.... the overhead bathroom light also turns on at the same time. So, instead of sneaking into the bathroom and then back to bed, you are pretty much fully awake by the time you leave the bathroom. Finally, the staff seem to serve not only as front desk staff, but also as servers for breakfast. On Sunday when we were trying to check out, we had to wait about 10 minutes while the front desk person served customers for breakfast. As mentioned above, the staff were friendly, courteous and as helpful as they could be, but overall, the hotel seems to be lacking in the little details, making the stay somewhat disappointing.

The property is impossible to find without calling the owner to pick you up, Every car will be damaged upon entering the road leading to the property We were staying at top floor. luckily there was AC! Guesthouse Cathrine is located approximately 2 km from the village, where are located the beaches and all the other amenities such as shops, restaurants and the popular nightclubs of Dhërmi. If you do not have a car available you will be forced to walk for 30 minutes on the main road, undertaking quite dangerous because there are no sidewalks and at night there is no lighting. There isn't public transport and there are only a few taxi. If you have a car, get ready to drive on bumpy roads, and work hard to find Cathrine Guesthouse: the structure is not reported on the main street! Before coming here we traveled through the whole Albania and we can assure you that the prices here are very high and people in general are not at all comfortable. The owner was very rude and avoided in every way to socialize with us. He doesn't speak english or any other foreign language at all! He didn't come to pick us up and did not clean the room or bring toilet papers even once. In fact, when we told them that in our apartment there is no kitchen as it was written on the reservation, he got us only a dirty camping stove to cook !! Incredible! Don't go to this place at all: the beaches are nice but there are other places in dhërmi where the locals are much friendlier!	Poor	2.0	5 reviews

We stayed at the tree house from where you can see the Volcano lightning in the night. Also the food was great. We did the tour to the volcano 3 times – we recommend in the morning, because this tour is not that crowded and touristy. We made day trips to the Giant Banyan and to the Kaston Vilages Yakel, where they still live like it is shown in the film Tanna. We also went to Port Resolution and the beach there and also to John Frum Village with its hot spring. Of course the roads are not in the best condition and you will have to pay for the transport, but this is worth it. You travel with the family members, stop with them on the market, children come with you to the beach – you get a little bit part of their lives. They also took us to a talent show in the evening in their village. Unbelievable experiences. We can highly recommend John Daniels Volcano Eco Tree House. We would definitely stay there again.

It was good that all rooms had a working refrigerator. The B&amp;B has a terrace, but construction was not yet complete. The breakfast options were very sugary, but the coffee machine worked well.

768	Gramartstrasse 10, Innsbruck 6020 Austria	A very, very good place. One could even say more – simply excellent. A hotel where there is everything for a good rest. -Spacious, clean rooms -Spacious, comfortable showers -Excellent breakfast buffet with everything for every taste -The bar is open until late -Free parking on site The reception is open until 16:00, but in case of late arrival, as was the case in our case, the administration sent an SMS with detailed instructions on how to get there, where the box with the room key (electronic card) and the access code are located. Simply amazing views of the Alps from the room window. The location is a little far from the center, but we took this into account when ordering, knowing that we would be traveling with a car. We ordered two rooms and were given rooms next to each other.	Excellent	4.5	3 reviews

Access is via several steps from the garden to the terrace. This features a table and chairs + plenty of drying rack space after your swim in the lake some 10 minutes walk away. We highly recommend a stay at Landhaus Danita...Dutch, German and English spoken by friendly owners who are likely to make your stay as comfortable as they can...if you need them during your stay. Very well-appointed building with much attention to detail; fresh towels, bed linen etc all part of the Danita experience and much more! Watch out for the innocent-looking grey cloud coming over the mountain behind you...though a quick shower can help freshen the air during the hot Carinthian summers...you might get a splash of mountain rain...keeping the valleys of Austria green and lush mid-summer! ...one last note: Carinthia, is very reasonable with hotel and catering (and fuel) prices ...currently making it ideal for families.

Originally two properties, its standard rooms are closest to the road and comprise of traditional Balinese brick bungalow style, surrounding the smaller of the hotels two pools. It's more upmarket and modern rooms are in the rear of the property, surrounding a well maintained gardens and the second, larger pool. The open air dining room where breakfast is served is also at the rear of the hotel. The breakfast is adequate and standard, with fruit, juice, coffee, toast, fried rice, and an egg station. The pools are clean and a good size with a few well padded sunloungers around both. Note that the most basic standard rooms do not have refrigerators. All other rooms do. The hotel is an easy 400m (5 minute) walk from Legian beach down Jl. Arjuna. Within 100m of the entrance to the hotel are many restaurants, cafes, bars scooter rentals etc. I found the hotel to be an excellent choice in the budget price bracket, especially given the fact it has two pools and us such a close distance to the beach. It's an older property but well maintained with nice grounds. It is far enough off the road to be very quiet at night.	Average	2.5	2 reviews

809	Postierla Immacolata 15-17, 74123, Taranto Italy	Slept as a couple on a Saturday in August. To report a series of irregularities and malfunctions: Showering with a trickle of water was a challenge, as the water jet is almost non-existent; The bidet is not there so to wash obviously you have to use the shower, as described above and 'a daunting task. In the same building that is always part of the B &amp; B there is the bar, nice place and also very busy on the weekend, music until '1 in the morning (as per municipal order) and so far everything is fine, except that my partner found herself forced to go down at 2 in the morning to kindly ask the managers of the bar to lower their voice. I understand that it was a Saturday in August but it is absolutely unacceptable to have to fall asleep at 4am because of the constant squawking, the barking of the dog and the doors slamming all the time. The thing that personally left me puzzled was that inside this bar there was not the clientele but the Owner himself, Mr. Andrea with all his party in tow with adjoining dog that barked all the time, to binge, overlooking the fact that his activity, beyond this bar, includes rooms that he rents to people who pay to be able to rest and sleep decently at night. You can be tolerant of many things but not towards the lack of professionalism and education and respect towards customers. Last chapter BREAKFAST at the partner bar that includes croissant and coffee / cappuccino. Having run out of croissants for the late hour in which we probably went for breakfast (11 am) we were forced to take the tart (the only thing left). We were shocked when the girl in the bar told us that we would have to pay the difference, because the pie costs more than the croissant. It is not for the 50 cents or 1 euro difference but I find this situation absurd. Obviously the girl in the bar told us that we are not the first to complain about this thing, indeed there is widespread complaint among the customers of this B &amp; B. In conclusion I do not recommend this structure in the most absolute way.	Average	3.0	4 reviews				HOTEL STYLE Luxury
810	Westerkoog 14, 25761 Hedwigenkoog, Schleswig-Holstein Germany	Wir waren für 2 Wochen mit unseren 4 Kindern (8,6,4 +1) im Haus Holle, WHG A. Die Whg ist mit allem ausgestattet was man für einen entspannten Urlaub braucht und war sauber. Die Betten waren bei Ankunft bezogen und es gab genug Handtücher für die 2 Wochen zu einem wirklich fairen Preis. Die Straße vor dem Haus ist kaum befahren, so dass man die Kinder auch mal laufen lassen konnte. Frau Folger ist eine nette, unkomplizierte Gastgeberin und immer für einen Plausch zu haben. Von Mo - Sa kann man Brötchen bestellen und ab 6 Uhr früh am Hof abholen. Auch frische Hühnereier gibts zu kaufen. Die Kinder hatten viel Spaß auf dem Hof mit dem netten Spielplatz, der für alle Altersklassen was zu bieten hat (Babyschaukel, normale Schaukel, Trampolin, div. Fahrzeuge, Sandkasten, altes Boot ...). Für die Eltern gibts Strandkörbe und andere Sitzmöglichkeiten sowie die Klönschnackbank, die sogar mit kühlem Bier gefüllt war. Bei schlechtem Wetter bleibt auch noch der Strohboden zum Toben, einzig die Treppe dorthin ist etwas abenteuerlich. Alle durften um 16.30 bei der Fütterrunde helfen und anschließend die Eier holen. Wenn das Wetter gepasst hat gabs danach noch Ponyreiten. Den Hofhund Bonni durfte man nach Absprache spazieren führen. Der Deich ist nicht weit, die Badestelle hat uns jetzt nicht so gut gefallen. Leider ist sie nicht abgezäunt, so dass überall Schafsköttel waren und mit einem Krabbelkind macht das dann nicht soviel Spaß. Komischerweise fehlt auch jeglicher Meergeruch,den wir sonst so gewohnt waren, aber dafür kann ja der Hof nix. Insgesamt war es ein entspannter Urlaub und unsere Kinder hatten sehr viel Spaß.

835	Pau Casals, 15, 17411 Vidreres Spain	I'm quite a regular at the Can Pou as my family live in Vidreres and this is just about its only hotel although a restaurant with rooms would be a more exact description. It is hard to evaluate because it really has no pretensions and in that it rather mirrors the small town of Vidreres. Despite its location about 10 miles from the coast at Lloret no one should see this as a conventional holiday stopover; rather it serves best as a very economical location for overnight travellers [it's not too far from the motorway and Girona airport] or those like me who have either a personal or commercial reason for visiting the town. It is cheap. I paid 25 euros a night on this most recent stay and for that I got a spartan but effective and clean room. They recently upgraded the bath/shower facilities which was a necessary step as in the past experiences with the plumbing have become the stuff of family folklore. Now things are civilized and reliable. There is a modern tv but restricted to local channels and the rooms are quite spacious. The restaurant is well-regarded locally for its take on Catalan food and gets very busy at weekends. The cooking can impinge on the room especially at weekends and in the summer. The rooms are kept clean with towels and linen replaced regularly. The building provides access to the pedestrianised heart of Vidreres, a small town with a slightly dated feel but also new housing and commercial developments. The hotel has its own parking. I like the Can Pou because it doesn't try to be what it isn't. Providing you know what you are getting it is a cheap, clean and useful stopover and on that basis I would have no problem offering a qualified recommendation especially as I expect to continue using it as long as the family live in the town.

As it is a guest house you have a common kitchen and you are free to cook. But they have to maintain the cleanliness and I haven't seen a single security guy in the building. More over during my stay I had terrible experience with the internet, there was always an issue with it. Kudos to the staff who tried to make my stay comfortable and get you what they can. At the end they cannot get you the facilities or resources which their management has to take care. Overall you will definitely get a homely stay feeling at this place.

The owner named the apartments after his daughter I think and she was there playing each day at the pool. When we had problems with electricity he was very helpful and brought food to our room, it was more like a hotel service. Also the room was more like an apartment with 2 floors, very spacious and balcony. Fetiye itself didnt have much to do in it (was some time ago) just some restaurants and bars but nearby town was much busier and full of things to do. We went scuba diving, great fun.

918	Hulhumale', Lot: 10818 &amp; 10819, 23000	This hotel is a total fraud. Perhaps further explanation is in order. I am not even clear where I stayed, exactly, on the night of Nov 28th. I was picked up at the airport by a young man who did not identify himself who said he worked for the Sunny Break Hotel. I was told that because of plumbing issues, I would be taken to another hotel close by. It took approximately 1 hour before transportation could be arranged to pick us up at the airport. At this point, I was highly suspicious that something was not right and asked the young man whether I should just plan to stay somewhere else. He said, "no, no, no," and called up the owner on his cell phone. I briefly spoke to a man who assured me that the arrangements had been made for this substitute hotel. I was taken to a place, eventually, that had no visible name on the outside or inside. By the time I arrived (11:30pm), I was exhausted, having been traveling for many hours. I merely wanted to go to sleep. When I got to my very small room, I was extremely irritated to find that there was no toilet paper or soap. The following morning, when checking out, I was told that they (the hotel staff) could not process a credit card payment and that I would have to pay cash. They also informed me that the transportation between the Male airport and wherever I was staying would cost me $15. So, I paid the young man at the desk $93: $78 for the room guaranteed through Expedia and $15 for the cab fare. I was also assured that since I paid in full with cash, that my credit card used to hold the reservation WOULD NOT BE CHARGED. I was naive enough not to insist on a receipt for my payment and one was not offered to me. So imagine my absolute frustration when I received a separate $80 charge on my credit from a separate travel agency: SMR Services, upon arriving home. I am currently in the midst of trying to rectify this with my credit card company. The people that run this company are total frauds. Stay away. Far away.

Pokoje/ apartamenty/ chatki urządzone bardzo stylowo i ze smakiem, w każdym pokoju są pięknie wyposażone łazienki. Pracownicy Lipowej Doliny idealnie podkreślają domowy charakter tego miejsca co z całą pewnością nie jest bez znaczenia. Jedzenie wyśmienite (najlepsze- widać, że Pani Ania oraz Basia wkładają serce w to co robią) podane przy dźwiękach nastrojowej muzyki. Krajobrazy oraz cała posiadłość mieści się w niesamowicie urokliwym miejscu...dookoła liczne sady, stadnina koni oraz wiele innych atrakcji dla bardziej i mniej wymagających osób.

The house is very warm, they moved in late in the evening, in the darkness and as in a kind fairy tale, the bed is comfortable, light, on the floors of the carpet, there is no noise from the street at all, until in the morning they opened the window, did not know that it was raining. Water is hot immediately, shower, towel, hairdryer, towel dryer, complete set of essentials: oven, microwave oven, kettle, small refrigerator (silent, does not interfere with sleep) dishes, knives-forks, TV, wifi. It's very clean, the landlady runs the house superbly. Outside, a table and a pair of chairs, for every room, you can read. The room doesn't have enough locker, put away bags and things, but it's not even a downside, it's like, "bruise", we were received with a big dog, no problem, everything is great. There's mangal, parking for a car. I strongly recommend using this guesthouse. From the house you can walk further down the street to the café "Baba-yaga" - approximately 500 m. (simple food for inadequate money, but with a smile and welcome) or take a car down to Artybash from the fork to the left in summer working cafés (about 2 km), on the right year-round service about 3 km.there you will figure out.

932	21 Timog Avenue, Quezon City, Luzon 1103 Philippines	The name of the place is actually called Casatina Apartments. I stayed there for 3 nights on a business trip and was very pleased. The room had everything that it advertised - free, wireless internet, A/C, cable TV, hot water, and a kitchen with everything you need to prepare simple meals. There's a ref, rice cooker, 2-burner stove, sink, hot water thermos, pots/pans, dishes, etc...I was able to prepare dinner and breakfast there every morning, which helped me save money. The room was clean. The sheets and towels smelled of bleach, which I liked because then I knew they were clean. The washroom was clean as well. The units are basic but quite adequate for the 2,000 peso per night charge. I was also impressed with the service, the location and the level of security. There is a guard at the gate 24-hr a day (actually the guard is the staff person on duty who also let me in/out of my room and took my payment). The staff on duty even stood out at the road every morning to call me a taxi. There's a convenient store across the street where I was able to buy mineral water and there's a supermarket and Starbucks within 3 minutes walk. Actually the whole area is packed full of businesses and restaurants so there are tons of places to to eat within walking distance. It's pretty quiet for the most part at night although I could hear some music coming from a club nearby but it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake. I felt safe there but wouldn't recommend going out late at night by yourself - that's just common sense anywhere in Manila. If I have to go back to Manila for a short stay, I would stay in this place again.	Excellent	5.0	1 review

942	Rue de Laeken 71, Brussels 1000 Belgium	The lack of transparency is the first thing coming to my mind for this review. the apartment was on the third floor of an old building with very narrow stairs making difficult, uncomfortable and even dangerous doing up and down. The re was no elevator and two additional ramps of stairs were in the apartment leading from the main door to the bed and living rooms. Al that was of course not said anywhere and I could just discover when I reached the place. In addition, the building is i a closed narrow road always blocked by cars parked by guest of a bar in the vicinity, it was also difficult to pass by there. Lack of transparency, cunnings are exactly what I don't like. A PLACE TO AVOID FOR SURE.	Poor	2.0	3 reviews	Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly)

966	Beizhai Village, Huairou District, Beijing 101415 China	We just got back from our trip to the Goose and Duck Ranch, and I read almost every review I could find before heading out with my two young daughters. I was a bit worried, but decided to a couple of nights in the lesser expensive cabins, because I wanted to stay longer and I don't mind roughing it a bit....but boy was it ROUGH. I figure there are two kinds of accommodations as far as price, the 300RMB room and the 800RMB room....or more aptly put, the room WITH HIDEOUS BUGS or the ROOM WITHOUT. Now I don't mind rustic as I said, but BUGS....BUGS I can't do and so many....it was actually nightmarish. So I am not sure if it is the time of year or if this is a year round thing....but we were infested with millipedes in our room. Once me and my six year old rid our room of ....(and I do not joke) 5 millipedes, two spiders and ten flying beetles...we felt ready to move in. We left the drain flies, cause lets face it drain flies are cute (seriously, we were creeped out enough with the bugs we did wrangle). I, being the awesome mom that I am, lied to my kids (so as not to totally freak them out) and said that they had not used the room in a while and that's why we had the bugs. Well, we were happy, confident and ready to play in nature....when we returned we were met with another family of millipedes....and so on every time we entered our room we had to deal with more bugs (we finally stopped counting but I think it was around 20ish millipedes). The straw that broke the camel's back was when one of the millipedes fell on us from the ceiling while we slept in our beds...that was enough. Next time I will splurge on the expensive rooms. I also noted that there were NO foreigners in our part of the ranch but the expensive rooms were bursting with them, so save yourself the hassle (unless you are good with constant bug removals) and book the more expensive rooms. I have not seen these rooms they could be awful for another reason., I was only told, that those rooms do not have bugs, when I asked to move (of course they don't....right...this is the land of force you to pay more for something that you should be given as a cutesy...like a room without tons of bugs). Personally with a little upgrade to the rooms they could make them bug free, but the staff don't care. We asked some Chinese guests if they had bugs and they told us that they did as well...so I guess we were the only ones completely grossed out by them. The food is okay, but you have to eat in one place with hundreds of other people and the food is meh... We paid ala carte. My suggestion is to pack a cooler and bring your own, you will be far better off. I did see people rent bbq's for their group and that looked fun, so maybe that could be an option. Alcohol is just beer and some other weird drinks...(BYOB). There is NO CONVENIENCE STORE that sells anything you would really need so bring everything. They sell a few drinks and weird odd stuff like a smattering of clothes no one needs and expensive stone carved Buddhas....probably in the millions price range, but I didn't check. The entertainment is as most have said, run down and dilapidated but fun and if you smile and someone in your group speaks Chinese the ride operators are nice. My kids speak Chinese (they are young though) so we were able to amble around, but if you don't speak Chinese, its a bit more difficult to figure things out. The best things about the Ranch are the transportation guy who brings you from Beijing to the Ranch for a really reasonable price (we paid 80RMB each round trip) and this is an amazing benefit for those of us who don't have cars in town. He's actually a cool guy too... Also good, is the beautiful scenery and fun escape from the city. My suggestion is to treat it like a camping trip, pack your own food, but for a one or two meals and set out for a natural adventure with peaceful places to park yourself. The mood is fun and lively and its a great getaway for city dwelling smog breathing Beijingers. We will be back, but will steer far clear of the bug house accommodations Lastly we did not go on a package, we paid for our room and the entertainment ala carte, for us that was best because I wanted my kids to hike and play not spend their day on broken down carnival rides...but its up to you what you decide....unlimited food and games with accommodation and travel for 800RMB/person (roughly) or 800RMB for the room and pay for travel and games separately (I recommend this). Since our family cannot afford the top end natural resorts in Beijing (well I can afford it, but don't want to spend such an outrageous price on anything really :), this really is a great place to get your nature fix and get away from the city, so for that reason I highly recommend it, and as for the rude staff....just smile, they warm up eventually. For example at the the "Western restaurant" (the only Western thing they had was salad) they ran out of Salad on the buffet, I was sad and said I was a vegetarian and the salad had looked good. So they made some for me, in other places that would be a no brainer especially at 12:30 on a lunch buffet, but since this is China, the gesture did not go unnoticed and I appreciated it.

1009	Via Enrico Mattei 40, 20097 San Donato Milanese Italy	Piccolo B&amp;B, ubicato in un decoroso fabbricato, gestito da una coppia di anziani (marito scorretto e scorbutico) che vi abitano. Le stanze per gli ospiti sono soltanto due: una con letto matrimoniale e letto singolo con piccolo bagno esclusivo (che avevamo prenotato telefonicamente per cinque giorni) e l'altra un po' più piccola, con letto ad una piazza e mezza più letto singolo, con bagno in condivisione. All'arrivo abbiamo trovato la stanza da noi prenotata occupata da altre persone che avevano prolungato il soggiorno, pertanto abbiamo dovuto optare, nostro malgrado (essendo già le nove di sera), per la stanza con il bagno condiviso. La struttura è priva di wi fi, tv e un minimo di privacy (anche per accendere la luce centrale della stanza bisognava azionare l'interruttore dal corridoio); la mattina dopo siamo andate via, nonostante si fosse resa disponibile la stanza con il bagno esclusivo. Per fortuna avevamo trovato, in tempo reale, in un B&amp;B centralissimo la disponibilità di una stanza tripla con bagno in camera, fornito di box doccia (che preferisco alla vasca), wi fi, tv, sala da pranzo - salotto con altra tv, uso cucina e ... senza l'invadenza dei proprietari, gentilissimi e disponibili, che abitano altrove, ad un prezzo leggermente superiore.

1032	Naousa 844 01 Greece	We stayed here recently and were shocked at the drab and dated condition of this HOSTEL style accommodation with hotel prices. TOTALLY OVERPRICED . This place is totally unlike the pictures that are posted up. Place was extremely basic, dingy and dark and a 25 minute walk through the town of Naousa to the nearest beach. (Beach that they have advertised near property is NOT a beach just a rocky 'patch' with nobody there). The tiny very dated bathroom is a complete DEATH TRAP with a 2 foot drop into the shower that you had to climb in and out of (with no rails) and if by any chance you slipped on the slippery dated floor tiles climbing into or out of the shower you could kill yourself. (Definitely NOT for children or older people) No privacy as the owner and her helpers were constantly walking past looking in and the outside area was just dried up waste ground and very untidy. Rooms were only cleaned once when we were there. Asked the owner to clean them and she just got one of her helpers to hand us in towels. BEWARE: This greek lady owner has very little english but when it comes to paying I would strongly advise that you pay for your stay only by credit / debit card and NOT cash and you get a RECEIPT.

1037	Friendship 159 A Bajos, 10200 Cuba	To be honest, I chose this place as the owner and I share the same name! I wasn't disappointed in my choice. The location was great for me and the accommodation was more than I expected. When I travel, I'm more interested in a comfy bed and access to food and bathroom rather than Egyptian cotton, high spec living area and European-style high rated food. For those 'more discerning travellers', the place is cleaned every day. The open-air kitchen-dining room immaculate and the owner is keen to ensure her guests are accommodated as much as possible. Speaking more than two words of Spanish (me, to my shame) is a definite plus, but it wasn't a hindrance in making myself understood. Failing that, ensure you download Google translate on your phone offline before you arrive. Re accessibility. I can't remember if it is suitable for wheelchair access but, I'm sure it's nothing that couldn't be solved with a wide piece of wood for a smooth, low-incline roll onto the property, but please contact the owner. People with vision problems may struggle a bit, but again, contact the owner to discuss. Would I stay here again? Yes!! The owner's sister and nephew made my stay more enjoyable and were generous in sending messages on my behalf when my phone didn't work. That wouldn't have been necessary if I had checked to see if my UK phone company and ETECSA. were compatible, but lesson learned.	Excellent	5.0	1 review

1042	Vashi, Navi Mumbai India	With all the popular hotels sold out, we camped at The corporate for a night given it was close to the place of work. Its a fairly decent place for the price point it offers. Entry is a little off, with a narrow reception and the main hotel entry through a back door. The rooms are clean, which was great and the free wifi works well. The bed is not so comfortable. The washroom is ok with running hot and cold water. Lighting however, could be better. only a 500ml bottle of packaged water is provided. The rest had to be paid for. The breakfast is best avoided. Its pathetic (the spread and the look of it) and I couldn't get myself to try it.

1050	2960 Corte Delle Scale Area, 30123 Venice Italy	We've just had another wonderful week staying in this extremely comfortable privately owned apartment. It is in a quiet little courtyard literally a few steps from a busy thoroughfare past the wonderful Basilica dei Frari. The apartment is very clean and well maintained with excellent a/c and heating. It is very well equipped for a short or longer stay. The area has everything one could need for self catering (supermarkets, bakery etc nearby) but also lots of restaurants, and bars for snacks or full meals in the daytime or evening. It is situated a leisurely five minute stroll to the S. Toma vaporetto waterbus stage on the Grand canal with routes and connections to anywhere you might want to go in Venice, the islands or the railway station to further afield. The Venetian owner lives nearby and is available for advice or suggestions but is also respectfully absent if not needed. We really wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when we visit Venice.

1076	Bldg 2 ul. Pugachevskaya 2-Ya 17, Moscow 107553 Russia	Главные плюсы это цена и относительная свежесть хостела Остальное, это минусы: Хостел фигурирует под разными названиями, в разных местах, что тоже не добавляет привлекательности, второе его название: Хостел "Кенгуру" (Kangaroo) Регулярные перебои с интернетом, низкая скорость, отсутствие связи в номере и в дальних углах хостеле. В номерах нет порядка, мусор может стоять несколько дней. На кухне перманентный беспорядок, занятые кастрюлями холодильники, практически нет свободного места на полках и высокая вероятность того, что кто-то съест твои продукты. Чистую кухню можно увидеть, только в середине дня, после уборки. из 5 туалетов на 1 этаже - 2 были всегда закрыты, а 1 был с неработающим замком. Обещанные зоны отдыха - не что иное, как просто загромождение холла старой офисной мебелью и хламом. Это плохо ассоциируется с уютом и комфортом. Если вы будете готовы к этим ожиданиям, то вас конечно порадует низкая цена хостела.	Poor	2.0	1 review

1087	SM-3 M-1 L-13 RTH-4 Playa Mujeres Condo Complex, Zona Continental, Playa Mujeres, Costa Mujeres 77400 Mexico	I do not always write reviews as most places I go to are exactly what I expected and never over preform. However, Estudio was way beyond my expectations Staff All staff I encountered were friendly and helpful even the grounds and maintenance staff. The Kids Club staff are super friendly and patient with kids and parents. My son loved going into the centre to do the crafts and play with toys. And mind you they have some awesome toys like Dash the Robot! All the restaurant staff are amazing and even stop to entertain our strange requests and teach us a bit of Spanish upon our request! The nightly entertainment for kids is great! Jorge tries his best to keep kids engaged but I think the hotel itself lacks a centre stage to put on elaborate nightly shows like other venues. Edwardo was very friendly and good with my kids. He even got me to get off my chair and have some fun with pool aerobics which I enjoyed. Food: Breakfast buffet is amazing! The quesadilla in the morning are great! I would fill up on them. The lady who makes them fresh is a super sweet lady too! Breakfast also has typical breakfast food and lost of fresh fruits, smoothies and sorts. Lunch was best at the Bikini cafe. Victor is great server and provides good recommendations for experimenting with drinks. We always got guacamole and chips to eat while we waited for our food. You can have food from the restaurant poolside too. Carols was quick and fast at bringing us drinks and food whenever we chose to stay poolside. Dinner is an issue. This hotel does not have a dinner buffet which I prefer. The place they serve breakfast would make a good dinner place!! The available options are decent. Room service food I thought was a better option and more relaxed as after a hot shower I could relax in bed and eat. The sushi place was good. Im not a fan of sushi but even I like it. The seafood place had good food but the atmosphere was horrible because of the mosquitos and though the staff provided free mosquito repellent it did not work. Luckily I had my OFF brand stuff from home. Rooms Great! Clean spacious and enough storage space for clothes. Big soaker tub, walk in shower and separate toilet. Resort Clean, big beautiful!! The staff are always going around cleaning and maintaining the property Checkin Easy smooth. Valeria was kind and knew her stuff. All in all this hotel is amazing for a fun, relaxing holiday with the family. There is no rowdiness or foolishness that makes it hard for little kids to enjoy the resort. I did venture over to the adult side and honestly did not find a big loss of not being there. The staff are equally friendly. I talked to the lady at the Art Show for a while and learned alot! I would definitely come back next year!

The house has been in the same family for many generations and the current owner has had it lovingly restored. The rooms are immaculately clean. The common area and breakfast room are beautifully built out with lots of wood carving and a gigantic kachelofen to keep you warm. Every detail has been thought of. The dishware matches the curtains which match the light fixtures. But the best part is the proprietress herself. She welcomed us with a warm smile and could not have been more open in making us feel immediately right at home. She allowed us to park our motorcycles out of the way behind the house. Rooms are large and well appointed. Breakfast included homemade sausages, preserves, bread etc... Normal coffee, Turkish coffee and tea to choice. With a few days advance notice, she would also provide dinner. I have stayed in many, many Gasthauses' in Europe over the past 30 years and can without reservation state that this is my favorite.

1116	8 avenue de la Mediterranee, 30000 Nimes France	The room was in an ideal location close to the railway station and close to a grocery shop. It had cooking facilities and your own bathroom. The deck, with a table and chairs, with views of the city was great. The bed was comfortable. Security was a strongpoint with the need to pass through two locked doors with a card type system. Free breakfast is available Monday to Friday although we did not understand that this was available until the second day. The receptionist, despite not speaking English, was helpful. Google translate or similar on your phone is necessary. Communication was not their strongpoint. Having messaged through booking.com the night before we left for Nimes, phoned and texted (in French &amp; English) the morning before we left for Nimes, to see if we could park the car before 4.30pm we did not get a response saying no until we were nearly there. We are still awaiting a response to us asking where the laundry was. Guest are required to take their rubbish with them, to the rubbish room but are not told where it is. We fortunately met someone with a rubbish bag who showed us where to go. You are required to buy your own dishwashing liquid as they only supply one sachet, enough for the first night and that cleans no better than hot water. Parking is not on site but in a separate building around the corner. We parked where we were shown and returned at the end of our stay to find a note complaining about us parking in someone else's space and asking us to move our car. If coming by car, do not set your GPS for their address or you will end up in a pedestrian area with a bollard preventing your exit. The hosts need to better explain how to access the accommodation. The booking via booking.com was under the name Twenty Business Flats which is not the name on the building.	Average	3.0	4 reviews

The 5th hotel in 2weeks and the hot shower was incredible. Rooms are basic tho everything you need and my room had extra blankets for a very warm nights sleep. All the staff are so friendly, happy &amp; polite. I wanted to sit on my balcony and enjoy a beer b4 the sun set and they brought me up a chair to enjoy the moment. Breakfast was included and it was the best breakfast ive had which was included in the room. Very affordable, very nice and we will be returning on our bike ride from Jomsom.

1130	Seacrest RosshillS Road, Kilronan, Province of Connacht H91 R9D2 Ireland	Reception: The host, Derek, was friendly, receptive and welcomed us as though we had known each other for years. He showed us to the room, checked it all over and detailed things of the local area. Room / facilities: Room number 3 is on the ground floor and is very clean, with a queen bed, 4 pillows, extra blankets, tea and coffee facilities, flat screen TV, welcome chocolates, cosy bathroom, bedside tables and a chair. Parking: Complementary with on car space for each room. Wifi: Included and good speed. Password is required. Breakfast: Available as part of the B&amp;B room. There is a selection of approx 5 menu items, which is plenty to start the day, plus various breads/ toast and a side board of fruits and spreads. Breakfast is served between strict hours in the house dining room, where guests can mingle and view the amazing gardens and lakes at the rear of the house. Conclusion: Perfect setting, great host, big breakfast and semi rural environment. Letdowns. The shower curtain is mounted too high on the wall, meaning water spills over the bathroom floor when showering. Location / Nearby: Across the road you’ll find goats and cows that the kids can see. The nearest small town is 1 km away, with all the features of any town, including petrol, supermarkets, banks and pubs. Galway is about 5 km away and is an easy drive. Parking in paid car park stations or street parking can be a bit challenging to find on busy Friday night or weekends.

1132	439 route de Buchy, 76750 Vieux-Manoir France	We received a very warm welcome from Madame Anne upon arrival. We had been delayed at the Euro tunnel which resulted in a late arrival at the guesthouse. Anne was very patient as I kept her updated by text message. We hired 3 rooms, which were all comfortable with good mattresses. The rooms and bathrooms were clean, but a nice addition would be to have some basic toiletries like hand or body wash or at least a small bar of soap. The breakfast served at a time that suited us, was fabulous with lots of home produce: fruit from the garden and homemade jams. There were fresh croissants &amp; breads, homemade apple cake, crêpes, yogurts and fresh cooked eggs (any way). We had hot coffee and tea, plus fresh juice. It was plentiful and kept us filled during our journey. We stayed on both our journeys to &amp; from Calais. Highly recommended. Thank you Anne for welcoming us into your home.

1134	11895 North Meridian Street, Carmel, IN 46032	I stayed here from Friday to Monday morning. I’ve stayed here many times for work in the past couple years due to location, and appreciate being able to bring my pets and the staff is typically friendly and helpful. I’ve rarely traveled at all during Covid and was disappointed in the cleanliness or lack there of especially in light of the posted ‘commitment to cleanliness’ the hotel purports. Not once were the elevators cleaned while here. I noticed the same greasy finger prints all over the ‘high touch ’ areas-button pad, hand rails. Maybe they don’t have cleaning staff on weekends, but hard to say your committed to cleanliness when no one is actually cleaning anything. No hand sanitizer in the dispenser on my floor by elevator either. In addition the hall to side door was never vacuumed. Pebbles and dirt all over it. My room was another story. I realize not every place is shiny and new, but all the issues just give the impression they don’t take care of this property very well. Cracked toilet and sink, shabby cabinets, fraying carpet, grease all over the door hinges and door, ripped drapes they tried to fix with tape. It’s just disappointing that they don’t invest in these types of things and try to keep it in good repair. It’s getting really rundown. May re-think my options next time.

If you are in the area, it is definitely worth staying here. The landlady, who lives around the corner, is very kind. The apartment is not large but it has everything you need (and more): one bedroom, which also serves as a living room, with TV and CD player. Breakfast is not served but there is a kitchen with all pots, pans, utensils, coffee machine and some basic food stuffs, some of which are free, some (such as frozen pizza or wine) can be purchased for a small fee. Everything was spotlessly clean. Parking is round the corner. Free wireless connectivity is also available. The apartment is on the second floor and there is no lift: probably not best suited to elderly people.

1230	175 Youngman St, Kingaroy, Queensland 4610 Australia	Absolutely disgusting. I had booked a queen motel unit for myself and young child, upon arrival I was given a ‘cabin’. When finding the correct cabin, I went in and promptly walked out. Disgusting and nothing like photos on booking.com. The unit attached obviously had a chain smoker that had a chair in the carport with an over flowing ashtray. I went immediately back to reception, was told that due to booking.com it didn’t matter of what I had booked I was given whatever. I don’t mind cheaper accommodation, however I would like to at least feel safe. I would not recommend at all with this experience, I have contacted booking.com as I have used this service for many years and this is my first complaint. Still a complaint issue that the service is not responding to. DO NOT STAY HERE THE CABINS ARE DISGUSTING AND NOT WORTH ANYTHING OF THE PRICE.	Terrible	1.0	1 review				HOTEL STYLE Budget

Appartamento completo di tutto il necessario, solo un po carente di armadi per riporre vestiti e/o accessori vari, ed un divano letto non comodissimo. Tutto sommato, una location abbastanza comoda x 4 persone.

Quite Spartan comfort, old-fashioned and very rudimentary bathroom. On our floor, out of 5 rooms, 3 did not have bathrooms: obligation to share WC and common bathrooms. And some have a window that looks...on a wall. If there was no air conditioning, the fan was enough to get a good night's sleep.

1342	Narshing Chowk, Thamel, Kathmandu 44621 Nepal	Located in the heart of Thamel this guesthouse occupies the top four floors of a residential building. This means that its quiet, clean, and theres a kitchen to use. The owner, Chhaby, is an incredibly nice and knowledgable guy. I have stayed here for over a month and love it. There is a rooftop room with a great view of the city and on a clear day you can see the snow capped peaks of the Himalayas. A bit difficult to find, but that makes it all the better - just ask for directions to Revolution Cafe and from there any local should be able to point you in the right direction. There is WiFi but its not turned on 100% of the time, if you need it just ask and Chhaby will turn it on for you.	Excellent	5.0	1 review				HOTEL STYLE Hidden Gem Luxury

1356	No.8 Pingliang Road, Chengguan District, Lanzhou 730000 China	Nongken farm hotel Nongken is extremely close to the Lanzhou railway station. It's almost at the intersection of Pingliang Lu and Houchezhan Xilu. &nbsp;A 2 minute walk from the railway station and a 10 min walk from the bus station.&nbsp; The approach to the rooms - The hotel is set in a 18 storey building which is located behind the reception area. The lifts are funnily located ... Not next to each other, but perpendicular to each other. As a result , you don't get to know which floor each elevator is at one glance . You have to walk by to each elevator door to find the same. The elevators are a bit slow and take for ages.&nbsp; The room - had a twin bed room, so will describe the same. The room was reasonable - a plugged LAN connection, no wifi, decent beds, bath was ok, hot water could reduce post midnight, the sink faucet was positioned too close to the edge. The wifi in the lobby was good...would be good if there were some plug points in the lobby.&nbsp; The late night security was an interesting character. He was constantly on the prowl across all areas in the hotel. Even tried to get me to leave the lobby when I was accessing wifi late at night. Later I figured that he was some sort of an agony uncle to the younger female staff and would end up chatting with them at the lobby. Accessing other areas - the night&nbsp; Market at Jiuquan Lu is about RMB 10 from the hotel. The riverside water wheels are about RMB 15 by cab. Minzhuxilu shopping area is close by. The other hotel with a very close access to the station was Hua Lian.&nbsp; The hotel also has a station for Where you cAn take print outs, handy if you are going to Tibet from here.&nbsp; The breakfast had a lot of vegetables and bread, and hard boiled eggs. Lot of options when you just come out of the hotel too.&nbsp; The reception is always busy, guess people are leaving at all times with the proximity close to the station. Not the cheapest property, but offers good value.

1366	Unidad 26 Mz. 20 Lote 1-1 Sm. 3, Puerto Morelos 77580 Mexico	This was our first trip to Mexico and our first stay in an all inclusive resort. We picked this hotel partly for its location which is quiet and away form the huge hotel zones of Cancun etc, just a small marina and a local fishing town, both of which are worth a short visit. The hotel itself exceeded our expectations. Wonderful beach, kept clean by a hardworking team. Don't be put off by other reviews which mention rocks. There are some rocks, but walk south along the beach 50 yrds opposite the volleyball court and its clear soft sand from then on. The infinity pool on the edge of the beach is beautiful and also very quite as the swim up pool bar is in a nearby separate pool which meant the were natural zones for the party people and those looking for something a bit more peaceful. Sunbeds do get reserved early but we always found some on the beach. All areas of the pool and beach are served well by hardworking waiters. Our room (partial sea view) was spacious and well decorated and spotlessly clean. The staff in the resort all worked very hard and had a smile and provided wonderful service but special mention to Helfital from CinCin plus the team working in the Mix bar. The design of the hotel meant that it never felt busy. With the exception of the last night all the food and service we had in all the eating locations, day and night, and we tried them all, was excellent. The only negative for the whole holiday was on the last night two of the restaurants were closed on the same night meaning quite a wait (nearly 2 hours) for the others when we came out for dinner at 7 and the food and service was not as good as we had had previously or in any of the other restaurants because they were busy. We could have gone to the buffet, which is excellent, but as it was our last night we wanted to go a la carte. But putting this very small negative to one side we had an amazing week in a wonderful friendly resort, which was clean, fun and relaxing with fab pools, views, beach, staff and food. What more can you ask - but of course do book a trip or too as Mexico is so much more then just the beach.

Folks ate pizza, pasta, salads, and descrumptious grilled salmon. A large piece of salmon, with potatoes and spinach for only 12 euros. Topped it off with "Strawberry Lasagna"--pieces of a layered ice cream cake made by alternating thin slices of chocolate cake and strawberry ice cream, topped with strawberry syrup, whipped cream, and a strawberry! The restaurant is in the clubhouse of the golf course, so there's a view of the course, indoor and outdoor seating, and a bar. Very clean and nicely decorated.

This hotel is among the dirtiest I have ever seen. Upon arrival we had the sheets and pillows changed which were obviously used. It is impossible to sleep: in the room the noise, shouting, dogs, means of transport is continuous. The staff is rude and unprepared, upon arrival to a specific question they replied that the hotel accepted payment by international credit cards and at the departure denied this possibility, creating many problems. The manager is aggressive and rude. Dirt is everywhere on the glass on the floor where the shoes remain stuck to the floor. The breakfast bowls and plates are dirty with obvious traces of food.

The cabins look like they were built in the late 1960s from a prefabricated design and are really 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom houses. As such, they have a real 1960s vibe in their fittings and furnishings. Whilst they may appear dated, the cabins are perfectly functional, clean and comfortable. In fact, they are so well equipped you could easily move in and live there. Sufficient provisions are left for guests to make a substantial continental breakfast and other facilities such as a washing machine are appreciated. Whilst all contact with Susan was by email or text, she was responsive, timely and helpful in her responses.

We were treated very well right from the moment we booked (which took place with Sarah) and upon our arrival Tiziana was waiting for us, two worthy HOUSEHOLDS, they put us at ease and arranged any comfort we needed, being a B&amp;B it does not have a kitchenette and I already knew this, but Tiziana gave me a small induction hob with a saucepan to cook the little girl and she doesn't know how much I appreciated the gesture, the rooms were always clean and fragrant despite the fact that every time we returned from the sea we filled it with sand, breakfast was plentiful (it includes two choices each between the pastry shop/bar and a drink from the cafeteria), the typical Lecce desserts, dumplings and krapfen were excellent. Furthermore, Natascia (the girl who works at the bar) is uniquely kind and friendly, so much so that she has remained in our hearts and we have maintained contact. The b&amp;b is very close to the Padula Bianca beaches and the center of Gallipoli, it is also close to the center of the village and there are all amenities just a few kilometers away (post office, bakery, super and mini markets, clothing shops, plenty of pharmacies, restaurants and also pizzerias).

I have read previous reviews and could see that people's perception of the owner Mrs. Adams may come across a little strict. Mrs. Adams does keep her B&amp;B to a very high standard (hence a few respectful rules). We have been fortunate to get to know Mrs. Adams and her delightful Jack Russell's Emma and Rhea. It has been a blessing to stay over an 8 year period and find everything still in immaculate condition. The rooms are bright, roomy and tastefully decorated. Mrs. Adams has a compiled file in the rooms on information and attractions in the area. The touch of tea/coffee and biscuits in the rooms on the coffee table and choc mint chocolates on the dressing tables is always a nice touch. Furthermore the landing contains mugs, biscuits and a range of hot drink options before bedtime. As per other guest comments the dining room overlooking the garden and watching the birdlife is always a joy. We look forward to future visits and wish Mrs. Adams every success for the future.

1457	Moletai 33166 Lithuania	Pluses - delicious food in the restaurant, nice view out of the window, a warm room, a comfortable bed and kind staff. We understand, that the level of the hotel is 3*, but both of our rooms looked as it was cleaned by a lazy teenager and not a person who gets paid for this job.. After checking in to the room and seeing the situation that the rooms are not tidy, we were informed at the reception that there was no possibility to change the rooms. Limp, water(?) stained floor, a non-working, dirty phone, a non-working bed lamp, a yellowed toilet cover. The washbasin, tap, shower head and cabin covered with lime. The bed's blanket is spotty and dirty. Tv was very dusty. Also, it is very unpleasant when in the evening, in order to walk down the staircase to the car, the light does not light up anywhere and you have to use the phone flashlight... In the pool, neither the current nor the fountain(?) works. In the morning saunas also do not work (but that's kind of understandable with current electricity prices). But, at least, it was very clean in the pool area :) Btw, if you choose standard room, do not forget to bring your own bathrobe and slippers. Otherwise, you can rent the robe for 8€ and slippers for 3€. The water from the tap is undrinkable, but you can buy it for 2,5€ for 0,5l I hope, you could fix these issues and we can come back, enjoy our stay and edit this review :) Good luck	Very good	3.5	19 reviews	Wifi Pool Hot tub Bar / lounge Restaurant Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly) Shuttle bus service Spa Indoor pool	Kitchenette		HOTEL STYLE Business Romantic Property amenities Wifi Pool Hot tub Bar / lounge Restaurant Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly) Shuttle bus service Spa Indoor pool Show more Room features Kitchenette

O local também tem parceria com um restaurante, então você pode pedir comida a noite, mas minha recomendação é que leve vinhos e frios de casa, assim pode fazer uma ótima tábua de frios sem ser incomodado.

1514	Quillota 658, Punta Arenas Chile	This is an adorable little bungalow at a very affordable rate. The staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to help us. There were also several additional touches such as cookies, juice, bread and jelly for breakfast that made it feel like home. This was by far one of the best places we stayed during our trip. It is an amazing deal. It was also within walking distance of shopping, the main part of town and the bus station (to Puerto Natales). Also, when eating out in the area, I highly recommend the congrio. Cons: The living room/kitchen is a little cramped with the sofa bed open.

In May of 2005 our son graduated from Military school and my husband brother joined us on the way home and Jack and Granny opened their loving home to this man and his young toddler. I didn't have any worries that they wouldn't be welcome or that little Jessica would get into any trouble. She slept well and ate great. Granny fixes one of the best breakfast in the country.

Ha un po’ di pecche però! La pulizia è molto carente,ragnatele ovunque,gli asciugamani sono vecchi e usuratissimi dai lavaggi(che abbiamo scoperto fatti nella lavatrice della titolare quindi non sterilizzati),così abbiamo dovuto comprarceli nuovi,i cuscini anche non ispirano tanta pulizia e le lenzuola vengono lavate come gli asciugamani,i letti sono piccoli e scomodi forse perché i materassi sono vecchissimi! La piscina è invece un pregio non indifferente,piccolina ma ci abbiamo passato dei bei momenti,la posizione e’ ottima per la spiaggia ma un po’ scomoda per arrivare in centro a rovigno,bisogna prendere l’auto.

1566	274 Voortrekker Street, Greytown 3250 South Africa	Had a shocking experience staying there twice now. Owner extremely RUDE. when we arrived it was load shedding and if there is no electricity there is no water in the taps . They do have a generator but after traveling all day the owner took alot of convincing to put it on in order to provide us with water to freshen up before our function. Then refused to start the generator again later that night which resulted in us not having water to shower or even use the toilet! Stay away from this place if you value your hygiene and service. They are unwilling to provide basic human rights and have no business pretending to provide accommodation and charging people money for a clearly unsuitable living venue!	Average	3.0	2 reviews

Meglio niente che un rottame senza senso) Bagno con doccia attaccata con il nastro adesivo. Vetro rotto che poi è stato sistemato. Mattonelle pavimento che si staccano. Tende sole non arrotolabili se non dopo averle unte e con gran fatica. Parti comuni tipo vano scale in condizioni assolutamente da non proporre ad eventuali ospiti paganti. Scarico condensa condizionatore che finiva in un secchio che regolarmente si doveva svuotare. Camera senza condizionatore con temperature vicine ai 33 gradi Per quanto pagato non ne vale la pena e comunque anche per molto meno non ne vale la pena lo stesso.

1666	Localita Belvedere 1, 06049 Belvedere, Spoleto Italy	The structure is located in a very green valley, with roads at the limit of practicability (be careful if you have a medium-large car) and above all without lighting. If you arrive in the evening, pay close attention to the roadway which is narrow due to both the brambles and the holes present. The room, very clean, has "vintage" furnishings; the large terrace has a beautiful view. However, accessibility to the room is affected by a very steep staircase with narrow steps, which makes it difficult to carry any luggage. There is the possibility of having dinner at the property, without a menu but by asking the manager what dishes he offers. The food is genuine, but the price is for a medium-high level establishment, which is a bit out of place both with the environment and with the almost zero possibility of choosing the dishes.

1679	Harbury Fields Barn Middle Road, Leamington Spa CV33 9JN England	We finally got to visit Harbury Fields Farm site after missing our break there in April due to the lockdown and it was well worth the wait! Sadly we could only fit in a 2 night stay but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We arrived just after noon on Friday with a warm welcome and had a free pick of available pitches. All were a good size, nicely spaced out with hedging between, a water tap and grey waste, hardstanding gravel with a grass area to park on and space to sit out. The site was very peaceful, well kept and had a lovely chilled atmosphere, with mostly older couples and a few small families. Hand sanitisers were outside reception and toilets had signs up, we guess to maintain safe use, but we didn’t use them, sticking to our own caravan. At a glance they looked like rooms with a toilet and shower together and looked nice and clean. The views of the surrounding countryside and farmland was very relaxing and our Cocker Spaniel loved the enclosed dog walking route around a neighbouring field. On Friday night we had a lovely fresh wood fired pizza from the onsite van. We visited Leamington Spa Sainsbury’s about 10 minutes away in the car, we didn’t see an on site shop of any sort, but it wasn’t a problem. Boring stuff, no site-wide WiFi, but not an issue. Strong 4G signal on O2 and good TV reception for the caravan. We are already planning another stay with friends in September (hopefully) and can see this being our local go-to long weekend favourite site going forward!

Access to a jacuzzi/sauna was a big and positive surprise. Yet, this is really isolated and you need to drive 7km to have diner. So, may not be for all, but for our family of 5, this was a great experience. Kids and adults loved the whole thing. The host was kind enough to give us a tour of the property, the cellar, ...etc. Planning to go back this summer.

The shower room does not have water heater, it was bloody cold water that we are not able to take a shower.

Despite our pigeon French and the couples total lack of English (their daughter does speak English well) we got on really well. It was a very homely welcome (it was like having acquired a French Grandmother). They provided a high chair for our son and travel cot and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was on the veranda and varied from day to day with croissants, omelette, fresh fruit and always something for our son too. There are only a few minor tweaks required to make it excellent to be honest. Newer lounges by the pool, newer games in the garden, larger wine glasses and sorting out the squeaky floorboards and I would happily spend a couple of weeks here!

It was very nice to have farm activity going on with sheep wandering by. Ardmaddy Castle gardens, Arduaine, Oban and good walking are all within easy reach. There's a handy local shop/PO which has an excellent range of food and other essentials. The hosts Nick and Bette were very welcoming, they had lots of helpful directions and info on the surrounding locality, nothing was too much trouble for them. The accommodation was spotlessly clean, comfortably furnished and the underfloor heating kept it nice and warm. We will certainly visit again.

1768	W2504 Northforest Rd, Tomahawk, WI 54487-8518	This campground is located East of Tomahawk on Hwy A on Pickerel Lake. This is a small lake, but the grounds afford access to a sandy beach area and small swimming area on the lake that the kids in our party loved. You also have access to rentals of canoes, paddle boats and row boats-but they are quite dirty/mildew covered-so prepare yourselves for that. But, hey, it is the outdoors! The campground is many seasonal sites of campers that have built semi-permanent decks, etc. We camped in a primitive site in a tent though and very much enjoyed our site as it was set back in the woods and felt more private than even most state campgrounds feel. Another member of our party camped in a pop-up camper and their site was big enough to allow their camper, their truck, and a large area for eating, cooking, playing etc. The grounds also have an old fashioned "putt putt" mini golf course with 9 holes available to guest, an old fashioned playground (yes, those metal toys folks in my generation grew up with), a baseball field, basketball courts, volleyball courts, and a small arcade area. You do have to pay for showers (4 quarters=5 minutes) but when camping a dip in the lake can suffice for us instead of paying for a shower. Do beware...that is the weather is rainy, the options for entertainment are not only limited at the campground, but in Tomahawk, too. We had a bit of rain on our weekend and so retreated to our tent to read and play games, but mostly enjoyed a fantastic weekend in the outdoors. Also, bring bug spray and after bite, the mosquitos seem to outnumber the people in Tomahawk! The grounds were very clean and the cleanliness in the bathrooms never ceased to amaze me despite the volume of use. We would happily suggest this campground to anyone, especially those looking for a fun outdoor weekend with family!	Very good	3.5	2 reviews

The personel at the estate told us the've had a lot of problems with the owner, and similar situations with guests not let in. At the entrance to the estate we were given a document stating that guest do not have access to the pool etc, since owners are not allowed to rent their villas out. We were left out in the dark in Frranschoek at night (during one hour we tried to get in touch with the owner, Ceceth) and after one hour, at 8pm, i received a message saying we had not arrived in time and therefore not allowed to use the villa. This happened in February, and unfortunately I still have not received any refund from Villa Angelica. Booking.com have refunded the deposit to me themselves and the villa is still banned from their site. Villa Angelica is not a member of the tourism board in Franschoek, and my best advise to avoid situatuations like this is to be sure the accomodation is on their list.

1803	Fira 84700 Greece	We had waited a long 4 years to get to Santorini and we weren't disappointed. Corrado the man is delightful and a mine of useful information. Listen to what he has to say as he knows the island well and how to save some money on what is an expensive island. We had room 1 which has a view over the caldera that is worth a million dollars. The accommodation is good quality with as many facilities as you are likely to need. It doesn't have a pool but that was ok by us. It is pretty centrally located in Thira, close to the bus station which we used every day. I would suggest strongly, depending on your budget, that you seek out rooms 1 &amp; 2 as these provide the aforementioned views. You could quite literally sit and watch the bay all day, with a few drinks of course and maybe a Greek salad! It really is that good. A general tip: avoid the taxis and save some money if you want to get out and about. The buses are air-conditioned and comfortable, at least in June before possible madness descends. We wouldn't hesitate to go back to Carrado Caldera apartments and we thank Carrado the man for his help, friendliness and the connection we felt with him. He helped make our holiday just that little bit more special. Thanks Carrado!

Standards are the same throughout the years. Flats are furnished to a high standards, the beds are very comfortable, the kitchen full of accessories. Everything has been thought through. I like the table and chairs on the terrasse. Wifi works perfectly. I have stayed in both flats and they are both equally good. I booked it for my parents’ first stay in Montreal and they also fell in love with the flat. Neighbourhood is quiet with lots of shops around. Baubien and Pie XI stations are easily reachable by bus, nice and interesting ride to Baubien by the way ( you come across a lot of nice restaurants on the way). Easy to park on the street although spaces get taken up quite quickly. But plenty of space on other streets/avenues.

1808	Carretera Matagalpa-Jinotega km. 142.5, entrada a Aranjuez, Matagalpa Nicaragua	We went to the finca today to do a coffee tour and we enjoyed it very much. Jürgen, the owner, was super friendly, had a lot of time to show us around, even told us lots of things about the cloud forest and we got to pick beans and eventually he roasted some that were already dry with us. He used traditional techniques, it was really interesting. He helped us manage our onward trip as well and we got to eat lunch together. I can really recommend doing a coffee tour at his place. The walk there takes about 40 minutes there from the highway and maybe a bit longer back since it’s uphill (unless you get lucky as us and find someone to hitchhike back). But the walk is really worth it too. The view is beautiful. Would definetely go back! Thank you Jürgen!

1857	29 rue Tronchet, 75008 Paris France	DO NOT BOOK AT THIS PROPERTY - THEY HAVE NO INTEGRITY AND CAN HAPPILY RUIN YOUR TRIP I booked this apartment in the centre of Paris, many months ago, for what turned out to be a major rugby weekend. We had been given the street address but the flat number was only going to be provided on the day or arrival - which was an cause for suspicion. A few weeks ago I was asked to provide a photograph of my credit card - another red flag. At around 5am on the Friday morning, I received an email from the property to tell me that my credit card details were incorrect and that if I did not update them within 6 hours, my booking would be cancelled. there was no attempt to call me. It seemed odd, but I updated them anyway and received an email saying that the update was successful. Then around 3pm I received another email telling me that my booking had been cancelled because my card details were incorrect. I called the property, who told me that the booking had been cancelled, they could not tell me by whom, that I needed to rebook for another time (clearly not a sensible response) and to speak to Booking.com. I suggested that the property would be free, that I had my card and was ready to pay, but they showed no interest in a solution. I called Booking.com who said I should speak to the property - I told them that I had and that they had pointed me to Booking.com! After insisting that Booking.com helped me to find a resolution the Customer Services rep agreed to call the property and to call me back. Half an hour later I got an email from someone else in Customer Services saying they had not been able to call the property - which was odd, as I had managed to do so. It seems clear that the property chose to cancel my booking and sell to a higher bidder last minute on a different booking site. They are able to do so because the Ts and Cs state that effecting payment correctly is my obligation and so it is easy for them to hide behind the excuse that the details are incorrect even if there are not. I had to find 2 nights accommodation at last minute on a very busy for 4 people and to pay significant transport costs to continue our weekend as planned. I recommend that (1) the property provider is removed immediately from any booking platform (2) as a customer ask all properties to provide FULL address details at the time of booking (3) booking platforms impose a cancellation charge on properties who cancel, just as there is for customers (4) payment details are confirmed (by both sides) well in advance (5) my excess costs are reimbursed by Booking.com who can pursue the property for those costs.

1858	Rua 33, No. 10, Volta Redonda, State of Rio de Janeiro 27260-010 Brazil	A única coisa boa é a boa vontade dos funcionários em resolver os problemas dos hospedes. Nos hospedamos lá em maio desse ano, quando abrimos o quarto indicado, ele estava em uso estava em uso, no segundo a chave não abriu a porta, para compensar o constrangimento, nos deram uma suite, tudo muito antigo, sem ducha higiênica, as peças do banheiro bem desgastadas, tudo isso num espaço muito bom. O café da manhã também limitado, com poucas opções e sem pessoal suficiente para atender o público. Se me pedissem uma sugestão, diria para fecharem o hotel e executassem uma reforma geral, e olhem que sou natural de Volta Redonda e sei que esse hotel já foi muito bom.	Poor	2.0	1 review

1869	15657 Lakeshore Rd, Union Pier, MI 49129-9340	We were in Fredericksburg and were invited to come by Firefly to say hello to family at Thanksgiving. Did I say entering the Pentagon? No. We wanted to say hello and leave. Have you ever heard of too many Chiefs? The front gate charged my brother ( the RVer), $150 extra to let us come in for an hour. This place may have started off on the right foot, but it’s definitely a management mess now. Not one person could make a logical, easy decision. I’ve owned my own company for 44 years and this place was classic. You never, ever, treat customers like this. The solution should have been: “Welcome to Firefly, enjoy your visit and make sure you check out on the way out the gate! Enjoy your visit and tell your friends about us.” The whole time, employees were buzzing the place, giving us the evil eye because there were kids. OMG! Kids everywhere! And we’re the grandparents. At a family resort?? Not family friendly as billed. Bottom line, go find KOA down the road and don’t waste your money on this place. Bunch of hyped up junk Tiny Homes with driveways rented by the minute to park your RV. Come back and see this place in five years? It won’t be there. Total disappointment.

1904	ul. Oktyabr'skaya, d 374, Gantiadi 672900 Georgia	We rested in September, velvet season, the sea is warm and clean. The hotel is located very close to the sea, the child said every time how great it was that we had just left and were already on the beach. In general, it’s not clear where the bad review on this site came from, the shack in the photo has nothing to do with White Panama, probably the machinations of competitors)) don’t scare people in vain. We arrived before 14.00 (check-in time), but our room turned out to be already ready and the hotel owner Jamal saw us off and helped us with our suitcases. The hotel is a four-story, beautiful white building. We lived on the second floor, but the first floor was also very high. The room is spacious and bright, high ceilings. The room has a refrigerator, TV, air conditioning, a wardrobe with hangers, a clean bathroom, snow-white linen and towels, everything is clean. By the way, there were no problems with hot water; solar panels were installed on the roof of the hotel, like in Europe :). There was an electric kettle and clothes dryers on the first floor, and an ironing board on the first floor. There is a cozy cafe in the courtyard, the owner Julieta cooks delicious and varied dishes, the prices are very reasonable (I’ll post a photo) if you want pizza, if you want kebabs, it’s very convenient, you don’t have to look for where to eat, and if you want ice cream or something else, there are three shops right opposite , it’s convenient that you can pay by card and prices are lower than in Adler. The child was delighted with the cute rabbits that ran in the yard and the kindest black dog. A huge plus is that all the hotel windows face the opposite side (you can see the mountains and the sea), silence, especially important for those with small children. In general, the hotel is cozy and calm, we didn’t see any drunken brawls during our stay, mostly it was all family. Those who love excursions will not be bored; there are a lot of them on offer. On the beach there are various banana boats, jet skis, boat trips and a cafe with live music. We were very pleased with our stay and definitely recommend the hotel.

1912	Carrer E, 6, 07740 Playas de Fornells, Menorca Spain	Went to this lovely holiday isle beginging of May, weather was very good though could be a bit windy, appartment was very comfortably and clean , we were warned about the possibility of ants and they invaded us on out 4th day, but we found if you sprayed mozzie killer near where they were coming from it did the trick. The site and even the island is spotlessly clean with lots of bins for recycling which was a very pleasant suprise and uf anyone has holidayed in Corfu you will know what i mean, the staff in the complex were very goid and accommodating and you could get hold if at least one 24hrs, we did nt need anyone so cant vouch for that, the beach is great nice long crescent not to deep but can get a bit rough when the wind us up, it is patrolled by lifeguards but they are very flexible to what time they turn up and leave so be aware of that. We hired a car from local car rental which cost €78 for three days which was great value and i recommend you do the same to see round the island, we did get public transport to mahon, the capital, in one day and that was cheap and reliable, again good value for money €3.55 one way. Now the down side, we went self catering as we wanted to explore the island so felt all inc would nt suite us, there is only one " supermarket " in the complex, and fiund it to be very expensive and the products were far inferior to whst we are used to in the uk, we did find a Lidle in ciutadella which was a god send, much cheaper than other supermarket and even cheaper than uk Lidle, there are a few restaurants on site, and once again we found the food very expensive for what it was eg frozen chips infact nothing on our plate was fresh, fish is even more expensive, we did eat at es cactus but sent the food back as the pepper sauce was burnt and my girlfriends chicken was raw in places, but i get the feeliing that because of lack of competition they have it sawn up on the prices the kast night we ate at okri steak chips battered and fried veg cocktail each bittle if wine one brandy and ine jd cost €78...which for what we had and the standard of the food was poor, having said that the staff were great and could nt do enough for you, i can t vouch for food at the hotel as we did nt eat there, all in all the hokuday itself was good, we were lucky wuth weather the week before it rained all week, to sum up, if you are self cattering i would recomend hiring a car just to get to Lidle, and to get arround the island there are sone wonderful beaches.

The staff could not have been more helpful, the rooms were attractive and comfortable (we didn't expect teak furniture, marble bathrooms, fresh flowers, and air conditioning for this price. In addition to the room and breakfast, the staff arranged a car and driver, plus a very knowledgeable, English-speaking guide to take us to Angkor Wat and other temples. They also advised us on other things to see and do, and good inexpensive restaurants to eat at. All in all, a wonderful experience.

1930	Pyrgi Beach, Ipsos 490 83 Greece	Abbiamo soggiornato in una casa di Angelina per una settimana nel mese di Luglio. La casa era piccola, due camere da letto con 3 letti singoli attaccati, armadio, comodino, un bagno con doccia, wc, lavandino, una cucina con lavello, tavolo, dispensa, frigorifero (piccolo e vecchio, non funzionante alla perfezione) forno (sporchissimo, vi dico solo che quando l'ho aperto è uscito un insetto) piastre preistoriche (non trovate i soliti fornelli di casa nostra). Ah! Dimenticavo! Le pentole che danno a dispozione, così come le posate, sono inguardabili, vecchie e malmesse. La casa di per sè è giusta per il prezzo che abbiamo pagato (eccetto particolari poco rassicuranti) ma il fatto di cui voglio informarmi è questo: il proprietario è un signora che all'apparenza può sembrare dolce e carina ma in seguito si è rivelato tutta'altro. I nostri vicini ci avevano avvertito che più di una volta, tornati a casa dalla spiaggia, hanno trovato la signora in casa loro con la scusa di annaffiare le piante. A noi è successo addirittura che questa ci voleva rubare i soldi dentro le carte d'imbarco. Si è permessa di entrare in casa "nostra" mentre noi non eravamo presenti e rovistare nei posti in cui la gente è solita a nascondere questi tipi di cose. A vostro rischio e pericolo! Comunque la posizione è ottima, Ipsos è il luogo perfetto se siete un gruppo di giovani in cerca di divertimento, ma non restate a Ipsos tutto il periodo di vacanza, GIRATE!!!!

The counter where you get your keys was completely messy, the floors had the smell from the below restaurant and the rooms renovation was far overdue. Carpet, toilette &amp; brush was not clean, room phone was disconnected and laying in some shelf. Old and crappy furniture. No hair dryer. Payment was “cash only”, no (credit) cards (even though the stickers on the front door said something else). The reason why we did not immediately leave to find another place was that it was late and we had to leave early and the beds seemed to be clean enough for one (short) night. Never again!

1954	Blvd. Bahia Col. Del Bosque, Chetumal 77019 Mexico	Stay away from this place, seriously, stay away. They use airbnb to fraud people. Here how it goes. When we arrived at the place the manager on site told us that they didn't have our reservation, the room is not ready and they haven't received our paiement. I showed them a proof of payment and they denied it saying they don't have it in their system, and also that the person running the airbnb ad doesn't work for them since March. They don't speak English and talk a really fast Spanish. Only my wife was able to pick some words. Finally they said that the paiement was actually just a "hold" on the card and they won't take the money. I knew something was wrong and decided to leave the place, ask for a refund thru airbnb asap, and find a new place. Unfortunately, we were not able to find something ok in the area and decided to return. At that time I haven't received any answer from the host regarding the refund. When we arrive at the place the second time they were very nice with us, and agreed to lower the price for a night from 1500 pesos to 900 pesos. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and slept there. A few minutes later I looked at my emails and the host refused the refund. I then complained to airbnb and I'm still waiting for them to respond. Later that night I was talking to a family who booked thru Expedia and, same pattern, they had to pay cash, money was also taken from their credit card and host refused the refund. Later that night, I was a witness of a new couple arriving and I saw them showing their airbnb reservation. The manager was again saying the same story and asking for cash. I told them about the scheme and to be ready to have their refund declined no matter what the manager was saying. I have a receipt from the mother showing that I paid in cash, airbnb should be pretty fast to respond and close the account of this host. He have a few ads all for the same place. Don't go there, we think they were all lying even if they were trying to be nice to us.	Average	3.0	2 reviews				HOTEL CLASS 3.0 of 5 stars

1956	Brueckenstr. 1, 65606 Villmar, Hesse Germany	Anlässlich einer Radtour haben wir in diesem Hotel übernachtet. Leider entsprachen die Zimmer und der Balkon dem Stand von vor 50 Jahren, offenbar wurde in den letzten Jahren nichts mehr investiert, alter Teppichboden und völlig zermüllte Holzplanken auf dem Balkon mit schmuddeligen Plastikstühlen. So was darf man heute nicht mehr anbieten! Sanitäranlagen alt aber sauber. Der Service freundlich und zuvorkommend, Frühstück normal ohne Besonderheiten. Dringender Rat: Renovieren, dann passt es wieder.	Poor	2.0	1 review				HOTEL STYLE Quaint

Dan was very attentive to my needs; he started to light an open fire in the hall area, which was amazing, he played soft, relaxing music, Dan just seemed to know what I needed! I came down for breakfast and dinner, and Dan was waiting for me at the dining room door and greated me with a big smile, he also said grace for me prior to all of the meals. Dan made this place, I honestly don't think it would have had such an enjoyable experience if he hadn't been there, and ensured I felt really looked after. There were a few things that could have been improved on during my stay, but I really don't want to review these, as my overall experience was good and I would stay again.The accommodation was comfortable and very clean.

1996	Via Sanmicheli 76, Padua Italy	My wife and I spent 1 night in June, 2013. The host, Chiara, is wonderful and speaks good english. She converted part of her house into a b&amp;b. It's on a residential street near St. Anthony's bascillica. About 10min walk. Free parking nearby. The room was clean and comfortable, including ensuite bathroom. Price was very inexpensive ... comparable to US motels. Breakfast included yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc with as much as you could eat. Not as wide variety as I've seen in other B&amp;Bs but certainly more than the crappy "continental breakfast" you sometimes encounter. Only downside was no air conditioning and up a few flights of stairs. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars, particularly given the price. On the night we were there, it wasn't too hot and the room fan was perfectly adequate.

Le camere sono realizzate con l’arredamento tipico valdostano che armonizza pietra e legno. Gran parte del legno utilizzato porta con sé storia e tradizione, perché è legno che proviene dalla costruzione originaria o da altre costruzioni di famiglia.

2039	No. 8 Jiuchang Road, Jianggan District Runguang Building, Hangzhou China	【客房掠影】 「酒店没有给我升级套房，但是升级了一间套房旁边的、面积较大的房子，比上不足比下有余。」 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“用心每个小愉悦”，这家酒店把智选品牌2.0版本的所有细节贯彻得有头有尾，堪称同级别酒店中的榜样、典范、标杆、代表和旗舰：客房最让我惊喜的地方是高清数字电视可以免费、免登陆收看近千部国内外热门电视剧和电影，实在太爽了。而大多数有数字交互界面的智选酒店客房电视机，想要收看额外节目，都是要收费和登陆的。 【公区简述】 「大堂有会员免费自助现磨咖啡取用区，细节上的装饰、点缀很多，显得新潮、精致、时尚、爽利。大堂咖啡机为拼配咖啡豆，餐厅咖啡机为瑞幸合作款阿拉比卡咖啡豆。对了，他家的袋装速溶咖啡选的是捷荣libe，和绝大多数智选都不一样，挺特别的。」 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;大堂有多个礼品展示区，包括智选官方周边产品（比如行李箱等）和酒店自有精品柜等，均可售卖，明码标价：前台配置的工作人员、接待人员在我住过的江浙沪智选中，算是多的了，得有五六位，一般的智选前台，就一到两个人，顶多两到三人，这也从侧面印证这家智选薄利多销、人气很旺、生意兴隆。 【早餐概览】 「早餐从六点半开始，但面档从七点半才开始（偶尔会提前到七点一刻），有IHG与瑞幸联名专属“小幸运”咖啡外带纸杯。」 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;早餐质素在我住过的智选中属于中上等的质素，比较有特色的是火山石烤纯肉肠、鹌鹑蛋、种类丰富且新鲜的水果等，不过自制酸奶机经常会忘记做，需要客人提醒：许多智选暂未开通与“拉面说”品牌的合作，即便开通合作的，相当一部分也是挂羊头卖狗肉（电梯里挂着拉面说的合作宣传海报，但餐厅实际上还是出品和以往一样的普通粉面），而这家智选是严格贯彻政策的，拉面说的烫头浓郁料足，点赞。智选2.0官方版“四时有序”（春-抹茶红豆；夏-芝士山楂；秋-金丝枣泥；冬-蛋黄肉松）特色中式糕点，有的智选是摆出两到四种，有的是按照季节只摆一种，有的则是一款也没有，比如这家。 【会员礼遇】 「赠送了欢迎水果、钻石会员零食礼包（有旺旺、乐事等）、欢迎饮料（无糖雪碧在智选欢迎饮料中很少见）。」 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“瑞幸”合作款冻干咖啡粉mini礼盒给他们家的配额只有200盒，由于他家入住的钻石会员极多，因此早就送完了，目前还在跟集团再次申请中：酒店洗衣和烘干都需要去前台买币，每枚15元，但有鉴于我是钻石会员，赠送了我两枚，很温馨（洗衣房的装修很暖心，喜欢）。 【独家记忆】 「酒店无健身房或跑步机。」 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;酒店我住了1148家，其中浙江省酒店打卡过48家，具体到省会、副省级城市杭州，住过28家：这家智选旁边是大型工地，酒店已经很努力地跟对方协商过了，对方也答应每天早上七点以后才开工，因此，是能睡个安稳觉的。另外，酒店地处萧山机场必经航路之上，飞机噪音比较大，但你不要忘了，这家的价格也极其便宜，鱼与熊掌不可兼得，我个人觉得其实性价比已然很高了。现在各个行业都卷得厉害，各品牌的车展全国巡展团队亦如此，这些新入行的小孩儿，每天的报酬只有几千，有的甚至只有几百。酒店方面，行业景气的那几年，供应商还能给他们订如家、锦江之星、汉庭之类的，现在则都是压价订不知名的单体小旅馆儿居多了。真希望主机厂多多增加些基层演艺人员的经费，把出差待遇提高些，让这帮涉世未深的孩子最起码也能住上亚朵、智选、欢朋之类的，以便在劳累一天之后，也有一个可以放心栖居的暖窝，祈祷。 【补漏拾遗】 「酒店的团队客人很多，光我入住的时候就邂逅两波儿。有一批是澳门来参访的学生，看到这些生龙活虎的孩子就像看到自己的俩儿子，年少真好。」 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;大堂门口外围是有隔离墩隔开道路的，司机不好找，往返时可以让保安挪一下安全桩，车子就能进来了：每天住一家IHG，把上海的洲际系酒店都住个遍，需要俩月时间，而苏州和杭州分别需要一月时间，毕竟这里是富庶的江浙沪，又是洲际大中华区总部腹地，店多、品牌多、影响力大也是理所当然的。	Excellent	5.0	2 reviews				HOTEL CLASS 3.0 of 5 stars

So much to see and do around the hotel, all within walking distance - China Town, Little Italy, cat cafe, karaoke, local cafes, bars, parks, restaurants. We were able to order Uber no problem whenever we wanted to head out - to get to times square was approx $20. The hotel was very basic, but we spent very little time at the hotel - we used it to sleep in, so it did the job. Came with a Roku tv, private bathroom and shower, two single beds, a lamp, and a bedside table. We were able to keep the room quite cool with the air conditioner which was lovely to return back to after the humid NY air. We slept with the AC on which drowned out any outside noises. From what I saw, the hotel lobby was the only place in the hotel to purchase drinks/snacks, which were pricey, however there was a corner store kitty corner to the hotel, which was very convenient. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NY and does not want to break the bank on a hotel!

2060	242 Union Church Rd, Franklin, NY 13775-4102	My husband and I stayed here in a fifth wheel one night the end of September on our way to Vermont. It is convenient to I88, but follow the campground's directions, not GPS or google maps. Google maps directions requires a crazy turn nearly impossible to make in our 31 ft RV. Directions from the campground take you around the block, avoiding the turn. The campground is heavily wood, which we like. Getting in and out of our campsite was easy enough. It looks like there are a fair number of permanent residents at the campground; it had almost a neighborhood feel with children playing in the early evening. It was not bothersome, and all was quiet after dark. We would not hesitate to stay here again. We we only here overnight and did not use any of the facilities.

We took the breakfast cooking class and now we know how to make tortillas and the best gallos with chorizo and cheese. Yes it is true that the access road is a bit bumpy but it is worth the drive. The gardens are stunning, the views of the mountains breathtaking and there is so much green and flowers all over the place. The rooms are immersed in the jungle and the river waterfall is the perfect lullaby to sleep like a baby. We loved the rooms, the terrace, the mattress, the cleanliness, the amenities, the linens, bathrobes, the coffee in the room, the fire kept us warm in the terrace and the privacy and tranquility, We borrowed mountain bikes from the hotel and went for a beautiful ride. We hiked to the river waterfall, and were pampered at the sauna.

2102	2-13-11, Ueno, Taito 110-0005 Tokyo Prefecture	On our second trip to Japan, being included in a small group of six, my wife and I had our first experience in a capsule hotel. First of all, the capsules are not as claustrophobic as one might imagine. They are wide and tall enough not to give a feeling of discomfort. Privacy is ensured by a curtain on the side serving as an entrance, and the efficient air conditioning gives a feeling of well-being. Furthermore, only the onsen is in the basement: the “regular” bathrooms are on each floor. They are abundantly equipped with different amenities. An electronic bracelet ensures that you can only enter the spaces designated for you: for example, men cannot enter the women's capsules, and vice versa. Breakfast – which is paid for separately and is good value for money – is served on the ground floor. The staff recommends booking it the night before. You move around the hotel strictly without shoes: complimentary slippers are provided. In short, this seemed like a good solution to stay in Tokyo on a budget.

My room was simple and quite big but very noisy. Needles to say, I slept extremely bad every day I stayed there. Breakfast and food was ok. The reception that closes at 22h is a pain in the [--], as there won't be anybody to forward phone calls to your room. Oh, I forgot the WiFi is just a bad joke. Expect to wait 30 minutes for a simple e-mail to be sent. I cannot recommend this hotel at all.

Having travelled extensively throughout the mountains, I know for a fact how difficult it is to maintain high standards in terms of customers service, rooms, restaurants, excursions etc. Alpine Resort is a jewel in the crown of Nathiagali, Pakistan. Everytime we visit this family friendly place we are pleasantly surprised to see new additions to the facilities being offered to customers. This time around in end of September i was able to spend 3 hours after breakfast with my kids with the in house zip line, mini golf, rock climbing (both for kids and adults) and archery range. Before that our waiter (Ashraf bhai) was kind enough to arrange our tables next to the kids play area. I would recommend the Halwa Puri, Chicken Qeema, Parathas, eggs and omelletes and excellent tea and coffee. This is a very kids friendly place which we regularly visit. Since the property is vast you get your needed fix of privacy and peacefulness. Rooms have been maintained well and since the last 3 years they always give the feel of a new build. We stayed at the 3 bedroom villa which had hot water and great room service. No other place in Nathiagali which can match the quality because of the fact that the owners are always on site making sure customers are satisfied. Looking forward to also experiencing the snow in December this year as i heard they will be keeping it open.

Rooms are clean, bathroom is small,but serves its purpose (only mirror is in the bathroom, something they need to address my female members tell me. Can't see how they look before going out.) Towels twice and bedding once changed in our 10 day stay. Situated closer to Salou than Cambrils Port,but buses run regular both ways (get a T 10 card,saves you money,works out about 61 cents per person per journey. There are a few bars /restaurants nearby,Molly Malone's is recommended. We dined out most evenings in Cambrils Port or Salou. Expect to pay around 70-90 euros for a family of 4 for meal and 1 or 2 round of drinks. Went to the beach in Salou,sunbed hire is 5 euros each, umbrella 7 euros. A trip to the old town is recommended,you can get there by bus or go on the tourist train in an evening which takes you around the points of interest. Went to the Caribe Aqua Park,again by bus and had a fantastic day,gets busy but queues not too bad. Hire a locker for 8 euros. Took a trip to Barcelona,takes 90-120 mins to get there by bus.

2128	Bachgasse 3, 55597 Woellstein, Rhineland-Palatinate Germany	Selten ist mir eine Bewertung für eine Unterkunft so schwer gefallen wie die für das „Gästehaus Maulbeerhof“ in Wöllstein. Zum einen muss man sagen, dass Familie Yergin eine wunderschöne Unterkunft mit viel Atmosphäre geschaffen hat, in der man sich sehr gut vom Alltagstress erholen kann: wenn man im Sommer abends im Hof – in dessen Zentrum der besagte Maulbeerbaum steht – sitzt, ein Glas Wein trinkt und sich mit den netten Gastgebern unterhält, merkt man förmlich wie alle schweren, belastenden Gedanken von einem fallen. Worum geht es hier bei tripadvisor.de aber eigentlich?! Legt man genug Kohle auf den Tisch, findet man in fast jeder Stadt auf der Welt ein geschmackvolles, sauberes und nettes Zimmer. Das Geheimnis liegt meiner Ansicht nach darin, mit Hilfe von tripadvisor.de die Unterkünfte zu finden, die nicht nur geschmackvoll, sauber und nett sind, sondern das alles auch zu einem Preis, der diesen Dingen gerecht wird: sei es das kleine, feine Hotel in privater Hand mitten in Phnom Penh für 50,00 USD oder das große Luxushotel mitten in Moskau mit all seinen Annehmlichkeiten, dass gerade keine 500,00 USD pro Nacht kostet. Und hier hakt es: meine Freundin und ich haben für eine Nacht im Juni 2012 im „Gästehaus Maulbeerhof“ (inklusive Frühstück) 95,00 EUR bezahlt. Wenn man bedenkt, dass wir auf unseren Reisen selten deutlich mehr als 100,00 EUR für ein Zimmer bezahlen und sich gleichzeitig vor Augen führt, in welchen Hotels wir hierfür teilweise übernachtet haben, muss ich sagen, dass 95,00 EUR für das Gebotene zu viel ist (hier spielt sicherlich auch die unmittelbare städtische Umgebung eine Rolle… Wöllstein ist eben nicht Wissembourg – von der oben genannten russischen Hauptstadt ganz zu schweigen). Fairerweise muss man sagen, dass sich der Zimmerpreis reduziert, wenn man zwei Nächte oder länger bleibt, oder auch, dass es kein Problem war, unsere kleine, alte und blinde Hündin mit auf das Zimmer zu nehmen (was in manchen Unterkünften gar nicht möglich ist). Vielleicht spielen die oben genannten Aspekte für den einen oder anderen Gast keine Rolle („Was sind schon 95,00 EUR?! Florian_Germany soll sich nicht so wichtig nehmen!!!“), ich für meinen Teil kann mich aber des Eindrucks „Wunderschön, aber zu teuer“ nicht erwehren.	Very good	4.0	2 reviews				HOTEL STYLE Quaint

2171	Tmogvi 0500 Georgia	This is probably the most difficult review which I have ever had to write. When my husband and I arrived at Zaza Guest House, we quickly discovered that we would not be getting what we had booked. There was no private bathroom, queen bed or flat-screen TV, but we were too tired to go somewhere else. The owner seemed very kind and insisted on us joining him and three other guests for dinner although we had already eaten. We were presented with delicious khinkali, bread and salad plus urged to try out the local red wine and vodka. Zaza doesn’t speak English, but we made do in basic Russian and with the help of one of the other guests who spoke Georgian. Zaza was very hospitable and wouldn’t take no for an answer, so he would constantly refill glasses when people weren’t looking. As the evening progressed, he started to touch me inappropriately – something which the two other female guests had experienced the evening before even though one of the women was traveling with her partner who was also there. When we went to bed that night, I didn’t dare to go to the bathroom to brush my teeth, as Zaza had started to get very physical in his approaches. In the middle of the night my husband had to go to the bathroom and unfortunately tripped and hurt himself. This woke up Zaza, who helped my husband back to bed and then proceeded to try to force himself on me, kissing me and grabbing me tightly. I managed to fight him off and run in our room and lock the door. I spent the rest of the night terrified that he could get into the room and wondering if he was now angry having been rejected. The room did not have any curtains, so we slept in our clothes. There was even a window in the door to the dining room, where Zaza slept. In order to use the bathroom, I would have had to go through the dining room and again be alone with him, so I stayed awake and vigilant for the rest of the night waiting for my husband to wake up and the other three guests to appear (I was extremely grateful for their presence!). The following morning, Zaza acted as if nothing had happened and cooked a delicious hot dish for breakfast. I was still terrified of him, so we decided to leave in a rush right after breakfast. Unfortunately I forgot my iPad, so I had to ask the owner of the next guest house to call and arrange for it to be send on a marshrutka so we could pick it up around Gori. This worked out fabulously. I am therefore very conflicted in how to rate this guest house. The room was not was what advertised, but the owner did feed us unexpectedly delicious food. He was honest and helped get my iPad back to me. On the other hand, it is never okay to sexually assault someone. If you are a couple of young guys backpacking through Georgia, this will be a fun place to stay. If you are female, I suggest that you go somewhere else, especially if you are a solo traveler.

2183	4F Qianlong Building, No.1786 Jianghan Road, Binjiang District, Hangzhou China	酒店新开的，客房数量不多，全部都在同一层上，硬件不错，所以叫精品酒店吧。位置离区政府有点路，但周边配套啥的也还可以，楼下就是好多餐饮店，有粥铺还有川味观，尤其离钱塘江也挺近。住的无窗大床房不含早，所以也不知道早餐水准怎么样，就出差住住挺方便的，性价比不错。	Very good	4.0	1 review				
2184	No.221, Nabalin, Xinhua Dist., Xinhua, Tainan 712 Taiwan	經常路過那拔，總是好奇這個小村旅店的模樣， 一次 在中午時間，總算進去休息了， 車子要在小巷中穿梭才會到達這一間連動式集合住宅的一棟。 一樓是老闆娘的住家， 二樓沒有冷氣，要到三樓才會有冷氣， 房間不知道多久沒有人住了？霉味重到不行， 三樓的2間房間我們選了看起來順眼一點的， 不過還是非常令人驚奇，輕鋼架的天花板有一部份塌了， 牆壁的油漆剝落， 讓我們想起在東帝汶那個民宿， 很難相信這是台灣，重要的，他還3小時休息收費300，超驚奇的住宿。	Terrible	1.0	1 review			Suites

2186	Prolongacion Hipolito Unanue Mz B Lote 21-A Centro Comercial el Triangulo - Frente al Terminal Manuel Odria, Tacna Peru	Me hospede en la Estrellita Dorada junto a mi novia,se encuentra ubicado a 2 o 3 cuadras desde el terminal de buses, su ubicación es buena, pero para llegar al centro de Tacna, se debe caminar 10 cuadras app o bien tomar taxi, los cuales abundan en Perú. La atención fue muy buena, ya que don Edgar siempre se mostró atento y con una buena disposición para los viajeros. Por poco dinero, se puede pedir desayuno a la habitación, el costo del hotel era barato y la habitación, se encontraba limpia, nosotros la ocupamos solo para dormir, por lo cual no pasamos mucho tiempo en ella (el colchón llego a ser demasiado duro, mal ahi). La Estrellita cuenta con wifi y tv chilena. La dueña de la estrellita, nos consiguió rebaja en taxis, y nos recomendó subir al monumento de la alianza, lo cual se agradece mucho, ya que no lo teníamos contemplado en el viaje. Nos recomendaron tomar habitaciones arriba, para no escuchar demasiado ruido, hospedamos en el 5to piso, y realmente el ruido era minimo En general, si vas a sólo a pasar la noche, es muy recomendable, ya que cumple el objetivo, es seguro y barato	Very good	3.5	4 reviews				HOTEL STYLE Quaint Budget
